    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(3) + sqrt(22). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down both expressions clearly:\n\n1. sqrt(1) + sqrt(50)\n2. sqrt(3) + sqrt(22)\n\nI need to compare these two sums. Maybe I can calculate each one numerically to see which is larger? That might be straightforward. Alternatively, I could try to manipulate the expressions algebraically to see if one is definitely larger than the other without calculating the exact decimal values. I'm not sure which approach is better, but let me explore both.\n\nStarting with the first approach: calculating the approximate values.\n\nLet's compute sqrt(1) + sqrt(50). I know sqrt(1) is just 1. As for sqrt(50), I remember that 7^2 is 49 and 8^2 is 64, so sqrt(50) is somewhere between 7 and 8. Specifically, sqrt(50) is approximately 7.07 because 7.07^2 is about 50. Let me verify that: 7.07 * 7.07. Let's compute 7*7=49, 7*0.07=0.49, 0.07*7=0.49, and 0.07*0.07=0.0049. Adding them up: 49 + 0.49 + 0.49 + 0.0049 = 50. So that's correct. So sqrt(50) is approximately 7.07.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) is approximately 1 + 7.07 = 8.07.\n\nNow, let's compute the second expression: sqrt(3) + sqrt(22). I know sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732 because 1.732^2 is roughly 3. Similarly, sqrt(22) is a bit trickier. Let me figure that out.\n\nI know 4^2 is 16 and 5^2 is 25, so sqrt(22) is between 4 and 5. Let me try 4.69^2: 4.69*4.69. Let's compute 4*4=16, 4*0.69=2.76, 0.69*4=2.76, and 0.69*0.69=0.4761. Adding them up: 16 + 2.76 + 2.76 + 0.4761 = 22. Let me check: 16 + 2.76 is 18.76, plus another 2.76 is 21.52, plus 0.4761 is approximately 22. So, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.69.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, sqrt(22) is about 4.69. Adding them together: 1.732 + 4.69 = 6.422.\n\nWait, so sqrt(3) + sqrt(22) is approximately 6.422, and sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) is approximately 8.07. So clearly, 8.07 is larger than 6.422. Therefore, sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) is larger.\n\nHmm, but the problem says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, in this case, that would be sqrt(1) + sqrt(50). But 1 is a bit of an odd number, so maybe the problem expects a and b to be as small as possible or something? Wait, let me check the original problem again.\n\nIt says: \"Compare sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(3) + sqrt(22). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\" So, the form is just the expression, so it's okay if a and b are 1 and 50, or 3 and 22. So sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) is already in that form, so that should be the answer.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me verify the approximate values again to be safe.\n\nsqrt(50): 7.07. Let's square that: 7.07 * 7.07. Let's compute 7*7=49, 7*0.07=0.49, 0.07*7=0.49, and 0.07*0.07=0.0049. Adding up: 49 + 0.49 + 0.49 + 0.0049 = 50. So yes, that's correct.\n\nsqrt(3): 1.732. Let's square that: 1.732^2. 1.732*1.732. Let's compute 1*1=1, 1*0.732=0.732, 0.732*1=0.732, and 0.732*0.732. Let's compute 0.732*0.732: 0.7*0.7=0.49, 0.7*0.032=0.0224, 0.032*0.7=0.0224, and 0.032*0.032=0.001024. So adding up: 0.49 + 0.0224 + 0.0224 + 0.001024 = 0.535824. Then, adding all together: 1 + 0.732 + 0.732 + 0.535824 = 1 + 1.464 + 0.535824 = 2.999824, which is approximately 3. So that's correct.\n\nsqrt(22): 4.69. Let's square that: 4.69^2. 4*4=16, 4*0.69=2.76, 0.69*4=2.76, and 0.69*0.69=0.4761. Adding up: 16 + 2.76 + 2.76 + 0.4761 = 22. So that checks out.\n\nsqrt(3): 1.732, as above.\n\nSo, the approximate values are correct. Therefore, sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) is about 8.07, and sqrt(3) + sqrt(22) is about 6.422. Therefore, sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider squaring both expressions to compare them without approximating. Let's try that to be thorough.\n\nLet’s denote A = sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(3) + sqrt(22).\n\nCompute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(1) + sqrt(50))^2 = 1 + 2*sqrt(1*50) + 50 = 1 + 2*sqrt(50) + 50 = 51 + 2*sqrt(50).\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(3) + sqrt(22))^2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(3*22) + 22 = 25 + 2*sqrt(66).\n\nSo, A^2 = 51 + 2*sqrt(50) and B^2 = 25 + 2*sqrt(66).\n\nNow, to compare A^2 and B^2, we can subtract the smaller one from the larger one or see which one is bigger.\n\nCompute A^2 - B^2: (51 + 2*sqrt(50)) - (25 + 2*sqrt(66)) = 26 + 2*(sqrt(50) - sqrt(66)).\n\nNow, sqrt(50) is approximately 7.07, sqrt(66) is approximately 8.124. So, sqrt(50) - sqrt(66) is approximately 7.07 - 8.124 = -1.054.\n\nTherefore, A^2 - B^2 = 26 + 2*(-1.054) = 26 - 2"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(34) and sqrt(24) + sqrt(29). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which is larger, sqrt(8) + sqrt(34) or sqrt(24) + sqrt(29). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky at first glance, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nI remember that sometimes when comparing sums of square roots, it's helpful to square both expressions to make them easier to compare. So, let me try that approach. Let's call the first expression A = sqrt(8) + sqrt(34) and the second one B = sqrt(24) + sqrt(29). I'll square both A and B and see which one is larger.\n\nStarting with A squared: (sqrt(8) + sqrt(34))². I know that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so applying that here, it becomes sqrt(8)² + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(34) + sqrt(34)². Calculating each term:\n\n- sqrt(8)² is just 8.\n- sqrt(34)² is 34.\n- The middle term is 2*sqrt(8*34). Let me compute 8*34 first: 8*30 is 240, and 8*4 is 32, so 240 + 32 = 272. So the middle term is 2*sqrt(272).\n\nSo A squared is 8 + 272 + 2*sqrt(272). Simplifying that, 8 + 272 is 280, so A² = 280 + 2*sqrt(272). Let me note that down.\n\nNow onto B squared: (sqrt(24) + sqrt(29))². Again, using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b².\n\n- sqrt(24)² is 24.\n- sqrt(29)² is 29.\n- The middle term is 2*sqrt(24*29). Let's compute 24*29: 20*29 is 580, and 4*29 is 116, so 580 + 116 = 696. Thus, the middle term is 2*sqrt(696).\n\nSo B squared is 24 + 29 + 2*sqrt(696). Simplifying, 24 + 29 is 53, so B² = 53 + 2*sqrt(696).\n\nOkay, so now I have A² = 280 + 2*sqrt(272) and B² = 53 + 2*sqrt(696). To compare A and B, I can just compare A² and B² since both expressions are positive.\n\nBut wait, A² is 280 + 2*sqrt(272), and B² is 53 + 2*sqrt(696). Hmm, so 280 is much bigger than 53, but the sqrt terms are also bigger for B². I need to figure out whether the increase from the sqrt terms in A² outweighs the decrease from the smaller square term.\n\nMaybe I can compute the numerical approximate values of sqrt(272) and sqrt(696) to see which one is bigger.\n\nCalculating sqrt(272): Let's see, 16² is 256, and 17² is 289. So sqrt(272) is between 16 and 17. Let me compute it more accurately. 16.5² is 272.25. Oh, wait, that's exactly 272.25. So sqrt(272) is approximately 16.492 (since 16.492² is roughly 272). So 2*sqrt(272) is approximately 32.984.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(696): Let's see, 26² is 676 and 27² is 729. So sqrt(696) is between 26 and 27. Let's compute 26.4²: 26² is 676, plus 2*26*0.4 is 20.8, plus 0.4² is 0.16, so total is 676 + 20.8 + 0.16 = 696.96. That's actually very close to 696. So sqrt(696) is approximately 26.4, since 26.4² is 696.96, which is just a bit over 696. So sqrt(696) is about 26.392.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(696) is approximately 52.784.\n\nNow, let's plug these back into A² and B²:\n\nA² ≈ 280 + 32.984 = 312.984\n\nB² ≈ 53 + 52.784 = 105.784\n\nWait, hold on. That can't be right. A² is 312.984 and B² is 105.784? That would mean A is definitely larger, right? But wait, sqrt(8) is about 2.828 and sqrt(34) is about 5.830, so A is roughly 2.828 + 5.830 ≈ 8.658. Similarly, sqrt(24) is about 4.899 and sqrt(29) is about 5.385, so B is roughly 4.899 + 5.385 ≈ 10.284. So according to these approximated values, B is larger, but according to the squared terms, A is larger. So that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the squared terms. Let me double-check.\n\nFor A²: sqrt(8)² is 8, sqrt(34)² is 34, and the cross term is 2*sqrt(8*34). 8*34 is 272, so sqrt(272) is approximately 16.492, so 2*16.492 is approximately 32.984. So 8 + 34 is 42, plus 32.984 is 74.984? Wait, hold on, I think I messed that up earlier.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, A squared is 8 + 34 + 2*sqrt(272). So 8 + 34 is 42, plus 32.984 is 74.984? But wait, that doesn't make sense because (sqrt(8) + sqrt(34))² should be 8 + 34 + 2*sqrt(272). So 8 + 34 is 42, plus 2*sqrt(272) is approximately 32.984, so 42 + 32.984 is approximately 74.984? But sqrt(8) is roughly 2.828, sqrt(34) is about 5.830, so adding them gives roughly 8.658, whose square should be around 75. So 74.984 is very close, which is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, for B squared: sqrt(24) is about 4.899, sqrt(29) is about 5.385, so B is roughly 10.284, whose square is approximately 105.784. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, so in that case, A squared is approximately 74.984, and B squared is approximately 105.784. So A squared is less than B squared, which would mean A is less than B. But when I added the approximate values of the square roots, I thought B was larger. So, actually, B is larger, which is consistent because B squared is larger.\n\nBut wait, in the initial problem, the question is which is larger, sqrt(8) + sqrt(34) or sqrt(24) + sqrt(29). So according to this, B is larger, as sqrt(24) + sqrt(29) is larger than sqrt(8) + sqrt(34). So the answer should be sqrt(24) + sqrt(29), written as \\boxed{\\sqrt{24} + \\sqrt{29}}.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let's redo the squared terms:\n\nA squared: (sqrt(8) + sqrt(34))² = 8 + 34 + 2*sqrt(8*34) = 42 + 2*sqrt(272). sqrt(272"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(9) + sqrt(17) and sqrt(10) + sqrt(16). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can calculate each value numerically to see which one is larger. That seems straightforward.\n\nFirst, let me compute sqrt(9). I know that sqrt(9) is 3 because 3 times 3 is 9. So, sqrt(9) is 3. That part is easy.\n\nNext, let's compute sqrt(17). Hmm, 17 isn't a perfect square, so I'll need to approximate this. I know that 4 squared is 16 and 5 squared is 25, so sqrt(17) should be between 4 and 5. Maybe I can estimate it more precisely. Let's see, 4.1 squared is 16.81, which is pretty close to 17. So, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123. Maybe I can write that as 4.123 for now.\n\nSo, sqrt(9) + sqrt(17) is approximately 3 + 4.123, which is 7.123. Okay, that's the first expression.\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(10) and sqrt(16). sqrt(16) is straightforward because 16 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(16) is 4. Great.\n\nNow, sqrt(10) is a bit trickier. I know that 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16, so sqrt(10) is between 3 and 4. Let me see if I can get a better approximation. 3.1 squared is 9.61, which is still less than 10. Then, 3.2 squared is 10.24, which is a bit more than 10. So, sqrt(10) is between 3.1 and 3.2. Maybe it's approximately 3.162? Let me check: 3.162 squared is approximately 10. So, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.162.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(10) + sqrt(16) is approximately 3.162 + 4, which is 7.162.\n\nComparing the two results: 7.123 versus 7.162. So, 7.162 is larger than 7.123. Therefore, sqrt(10) + sqrt(16) is larger than sqrt(9) + sqrt(17).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify my calculations because I might have made an error somewhere. So, sqrt(17) I approximated as 4.123, but actually, 4.123 squared is 16.81, which is 0.19 less than 17. So, the actual sqrt(17) is just a bit more than 4.123, maybe 4.123 + a little bit. Similarly, sqrt(10) I approximated as 3.162, but 3.162 squared is about 10, so that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute sqrt(17) more accurately. Let's see, 4.1 squared is 16.81, 4.12 squared is (4.1 + 0.02)^2 = 4.1^2 + 2*4.1*0.02 + 0.02^2 = 16.81 + 0.164 + 0.0004 = 16.9744. Hmm, 16.9744 is still less than 17. So, 4.12 squared is 16.9744, which is 0.0256 less than 17. Therefore, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.12 + (0.0256)/(2*4.12) by linear approximation. Wait, that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's use a calculator approach. Let's see, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123105625617661. So, it's about 4.1231. Similarly, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.162277660168379. So, my approximations were pretty close.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(10) + sqrt(16) is approximately 3.162277660168379 + 4 = 7.162277660168379, and sqrt(9) + sqrt(17) is 3 + 4.123105625617661 = 7.123105625617661. So, yes, 7.16227766... is larger than 7.12310562... So, sqrt(10) + sqrt(16) is larger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can square both expressions to eliminate the square roots and compare the squares. That might be a more precise method.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(9) + sqrt(17) = 3 + sqrt(17), and B = sqrt(10) + sqrt(16) = sqrt(10) + 4.\n\nIf I compute A squared and B squared, I can compare them numerically.\n\nCompute A squared: (sqrt(9) + sqrt(17))^2 = 9 + 2*sqrt(9*17) + 17 = 26 + 2*sqrt(153). Similarly, sqrt(153) is approximately 12.369, so A squared is approximately 26 + 2*12.369 = 26 + 24.738 = 50.738.\n\nCompute B squared: (sqrt(10) + 4)^2 = 10 + 8*sqrt(10) + 16 = 26 + 8*sqrt(10). sqrt(10) is approximately 3.162, so 8*sqrt(10) is approximately 25.296. Therefore, B squared is approximately 26 + 25.296 = 51.296.\n\nComparing A squared (~50.738) and B squared (~51.296), B squared is larger, so B is larger than A.\n\nHmm, that's consistent with my earlier numerical comparison.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the difference between the two expressions. Let me compute B - A = (sqrt(10) + sqrt(16)) - (sqrt(9) + sqrt(17)) = sqrt(10) - sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) - sqrt(17). Since sqrt(16) - sqrt(17) is negative, and sqrt(10) - sqrt(9) is also negative, but which one is more negative? Let's see, sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123, so sqrt(16) - sqrt(17) is approximately -0.123. Similarly, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.162, sqrt(9) is 3, so sqrt(10) - sqrt(9) is approximately 0.162. So, B - A is approximately 0.162 - 0.123 = 0.039. So, B is larger by about 0.039.\n\nTherefore, B is larger than A. So, sqrt(10) + sqrt(16) is larger than sqrt(9) + sqrt(17).\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute sqrt(17) more accurately. Let's use linear approximation between 4.12 and 4.13.\n\nAt x = 4.12, we have f(x) = x^2 = 16.9744, and we need to find the x where f(x) = 17.\n\nThe derivative f'(x) = 2x, so at x = 4.12, f'(x) = 8.24.\n\nSo, the linear approximation is f(x + delta) ≈ f(x) + f'(x)*delta.\n\nWe have f(x) = 16.9744, f(x + delta) = 17.\n\nSo, 17 ≈ 16.9744 + 8.24*delta.\n\nTherefore, delta ≈ (17 - 16.9744)/8.24 ≈ (0.0256)/8.24 ≈ 0.0031.\n\nSo, x ≈ 4.12 + 0.0031 ≈ 4.1"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(37) + sqrt(45). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and express the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, let me just write down both expressions clearly so I can see them:\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(2) + sqrt(49)\nExpression 2: sqrt(37) + sqrt(45)\n\nAlright, so I need to compare these two. Since both are sums of square roots, maybe I can simplify them or find some way to estimate their values to see which one is bigger. Let me start by simplifying each term if possible.\n\nLooking at Expression 1: sqrt(49) is a perfect square because 7*7=49. So, sqrt(49) is 7. That means Expression 1 simplifies to sqrt(2) + 7. Similarly, let me check Expression 2: sqrt(37) and sqrt(45). Hmm, neither of these are perfect squares, so they can't be simplified further.\n\nSo, now, Expression 1 is sqrt(2) + 7 and Expression 2 is sqrt(37) + sqrt(45). To compare these two, maybe I can approximate their numerical values. That might be the easiest way for me right now.\n\nLet me start with Expression 1: sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142. Adding that to 7 gives me around 8.4142. So, Expression 1 is roughly 8.4142.\n\nNow, moving on to Expression 2: sqrt(37) and sqrt(45). Let's approximate each of these. I know that sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(37) is just a bit more than 6. Let me calculate it more precisely. Using a calculator, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08276. Similarly, sqrt(45) is a bit less than sqrt(49), which is 7, because 45 is 4 less than 49. Let me compute that: sqrt(45) is approximately 6.70820. So, adding these two together, sqrt(37) + sqrt(45) is approximately 6.08276 + 6.70820, which equals 12.79096.\n\nWait a second, hold on. That can't be right. If Expression 1 is about 8.4142 and Expression 2 is about 12.79096, then Expression 2 is definitely larger. But I feel like maybe I'm missing something because the problem seems more interesting. Maybe I made a mistake in my approximations?\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. Starting with sqrt(37): 6^2 is 36, so 6.08^2 is 6.08*6.08. Let's compute 6*6=36, 6*0.08=0.48, 0.08*6=0.48, and 0.08*0.08=0.0064. Adding all these up: 36 + 0.48 + 0.48 + 0.0064 = 36 + 0.96 + 0.0064 = 36.9664. Hmm, that's 6.08^2. So, 6.08*6.08 is approximately 36.9664, which is actually just 37. So, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08276. So, that part is correct.\n\nNow, sqrt(45): 6.7^2 is 44.89, which is very close to 45. Let me compute 6.7*6.7: 6*6=36, 6*0.7=4.2, 0.7*6=4.2, and 0.7*0.7=0.49. So, 36 + 4.2 + 4.2 + 0.49 = 36 + 8.4 + 0.49 = 44.89. So, 6.7^2 is 44.89, which is just 0.11 less than 45. So, sqrt(45) is approximately 6.7 + (0.11)/(2*6.7). Using the linear approximation for square roots: sqrt(x + dx) ≈ sqrt(x) + (dx)/(2*sqrt(x)). So, dx here is 0.11, and x is 44.89. So, sqrt(45) ≈ 6.7 + 0.11/(2*6.7) ≈ 6.7 + 0.11/13.4 ≈ 6.7 + 0.0082 ≈ 6.7082. So, that's consistent with my earlier approximation.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(37) + sqrt(45) is approximately 6.08276 + 6.7082, which is 12.79096. That seems correct.\n\nNow, Expression 1 is sqrt(2) + 7 ≈ 1.4142 + 7 = 8.4142. So, indeed, 8.4142 is less than 12.79096. So, Expression 2 is larger.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) would be Expression 2: sqrt(37) + sqrt(45). So, I think that's it.\n\nBut hold on, I feel like maybe I should check my reasoning again because it feels a bit too straightforward, and the problem is presented as if it's more challenging. Maybe I need to see if there's another way to compare these expressions without approximating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can square both expressions and compare the results. Since both are sums of square roots, squaring them might help me figure out which one is larger.\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote Expression 1 as A = sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) = sqrt(2) + 7, and Expression 2 as B = sqrt(37) + sqrt(45).\n\nSo, to compare A and B, let's compute A^2 and B^2 and see which one is larger.\n\nFirst, compute A^2:\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(2) + 7)^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*7 + 7^2 = 2 + 14*sqrt(2) + 49 = 51 + 14*sqrt(2).\n\nSimilarly, compute B^2:\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(37) + sqrt(45))^2 = (sqrt(37))^2 + 2*sqrt(37)*sqrt(45) + (sqrt(45))^2 = 37 + 2*sqrt(37*45) + 45 = 82 + 2*sqrt(1665).\n\nNow, let's compute both A^2 and B^2 numerically to compare them.\n\nFirst, A^2 = 51 + 14*sqrt(2). We know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so 14*sqrt(2) is approximately 14*1.4142 ≈ 19.7988. Therefore, A^2 ≈ 51 + 19.7988 ≈ 70.7988.\n\nNext, B^2 = 82 + 2*sqrt(1665). Let's compute sqrt(1665). Hmm, 40^2 is 1600, so sqrt(1665) is a bit more than 40. Let me compute 40^2 = 1600, 41^2 = 1681, so sqrt(1665) is between 40 and 41. Let me approximate it.\n\nCompute 40.8^2: 40^2 + 2*40*0.8 + 0.8^2 = 1600 + 64 + 0.64 = 1664.64. That's very close to 1665. So, sqrt(1665) ≈ 40.8 + (1665 - 1664.64)/(2*40.8). The difference is 0.36, so 0.36/(81.6) ≈ 0.0044. So, sqrt(1665) ≈ 40.8 + 0.004"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) and sqrt(7) + sqrt(26). The goal is to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(4) is just 2 because 2 squared is 4. So sqrt(4) is straightforward. That part is easy. Now, sqrt(42) is a bit trickier because it's not a perfect square. Similarly, sqrt(7) and sqrt(26) are both irrational numbers. I need to figure out which combination, when added together, gives a larger sum.\n\nMaybe I can compare each pair separately? Let's see. If I compute sqrt(42) and sqrt(26) and then add them to sqrt(7), which is about 2.6458, I can get an approximate idea. Alternatively, I can find exact values or maybe use some estimation techniques.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe I can square both expressions to compare them. Since both are sums of square roots, squaring them might make it easier to compare without dealing with square roots directly. But hold on, squaring a sum of square roots can lead to cross terms, which might complicate things. Let me think about how that works.\n\nIf I let A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) and B = sqrt(7) + sqrt(26), then A^2 = (sqrt(4) + sqrt(42))^2 and B^2 = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(26))^2. Let's compute both:\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(4))^2 + 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))^2\n= 4 + 2*sqrt(168) + 42\n= 46 + 2*sqrt(168)\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(7))^2 + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(26) + (sqrt(26))^2\n= 7 + 2*sqrt(182) + 26\n= 33 + 2*sqrt(182)\n\nHmm, so now I have A^2 = 46 + 2*sqrt(168) and B^2 = 33 + 2*sqrt(182). To compare A and B, I can compare A^2 and B^2. So, which is larger: 46 + 2*sqrt(168) or 33 + 2*sqrt(182)?\n\nLet me subtract B^2 from A^2 to see the difference:\n\n(46 + 2*sqrt(168)) - (33 + 2*sqrt(182)) = 13 + 2*(sqrt(168) - sqrt(182))\n\nNow, sqrt(168) is approximately 12.96 and sqrt(182) is approximately 13.49. So, sqrt(168) - sqrt(182) is approximately 12.96 - 13.49 = -0.53. Therefore, 2*(sqrt(168) - sqrt(182)) is approximately 2*(-0.53) = -1.06.\n\nSo, 13 + (-1.06) = 11.94, which is positive. Therefore, A^2 - B^2 is approximately 11.94, which is positive. That means A^2 > B^2, so A > B. Therefore, sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) is larger than sqrt(7) + sqrt(26).\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify:\n\nCompute sqrt(168): 168 is 12.96^2 because 13^2 is 169, so sqrt(168) is just a bit less than 13, maybe around 12.96.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(182): 182 is 13.49^2 because 13^2 is 169 and 14^2 is 196. So, sqrt(182) is a bit less than 14, maybe around 13.49.\n\nSo, sqrt(168) - sqrt(182) ≈ 12.96 - 13.49 ≈ -0.53, as before.\n\nThus, 2*(sqrt(168) - sqrt(182)) ≈ -1.06.\n\nThen, A^2 - B^2 ≈ 13 + (-1.06) = 11.94, which is positive. So yes, A^2 is bigger than B^2, so A is bigger than B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the approximate decimal values to double-check.\n\nCompute sqrt(4) = 2, sqrt(42) ≈ 6.4807, so A ≈ 2 + 6.4807 ≈ 8.4807.\n\nCompute sqrt(7) ≈ 2.6458, sqrt(26) ≈ 5.0990, so B ≈ 2.6458 + 5.0990 ≈ 7.7448.\n\nComparing A ≈ 8.4807 and B ≈ 7.7448, clearly A is larger. So that confirms it.\n\nAnother way is to subtract the expressions: A - B ≈ 8.4807 - 7.7448 ≈ 0.7359, which is positive. So, A is larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) is larger, so the answer is sqrt(4) + sqrt(42). Since sqrt(4) is 2, but in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), it's already written as sqrt(4) + sqrt(42), so a=4 and b=42.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't overlook anything, is there another way to compare sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) and sqrt(7) + sqrt(26)?\n\nMaybe by rationalizing or using some inequality, but squaring seems straightforward and gave a clear answer.\n\nAlso, thinking about the numbers: sqrt(42) is significantly larger than sqrt(26), but sqrt(7) is only about 2.6458, which is less than sqrt(4) = 2. Wait, hold on: sqrt(4) is 2, which is larger than sqrt(7) ≈ 2.6458? Wait, no, sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458, which is larger than 2. Wait, so sqrt(7) is larger than sqrt(4). Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nSo, sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458, which is larger than sqrt(4) which is 2. Then, sqrt(42) is approximately 6.4807, which is larger than sqrt(26) which is approximately 5.0990. So, in terms of the components, sqrt(42) is larger than sqrt(26), but sqrt(7) is larger than sqrt(4). So, the larger component is sqrt(42) vs sqrt(26), and the smaller component is sqrt(7) vs sqrt(4). So, which effect is stronger?\n\nThe sum is sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) vs sqrt(7) + sqrt(26). So, the sqrt(42) is a much larger number than sqrt(26), but sqrt(7) is a lot larger than sqrt(4). So, the question is whether the increase in sqrt(42) is enough to outweigh the decrease in sqrt(7) compared to sqrt(4).\n\nSince sqrt(42) is significantly larger, but sqrt(7) is also significantly larger, maybe the net effect is positive.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the difference between the two:\n\nsqrt(42) - sqrt(26) vs sqrt(7) - sqrt(4).\n\nIf sqrt(42) - sqrt(26) > sqrt(7) - sqrt(4), then A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) > B = sqrt(7) + sqrt(26).\n\nLet me compute both differences:\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(42) - sqrt(26):\n\nsqrt(42) ≈ 6.4807\n\nsqrt(26) ≈ 5.0990\n\nSo, 6.4807 - 5.0990 ≈ 1.3817.\n\nNext, compute sqrt(7) - sqrt(4):\n\nsqrt(7) ≈ 2.6458\n\nsqrt(4) = 2\n\nSo, 2.6458 - 2 ≈ 0.6458.\n\nSo, 1.3817 > 0.645"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(14) + sqrt(44) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(43). The goal is to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when comparing two square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help eliminate the square roots and make it easier to compare. Since both expressions involve square roots, I can try squaring each to see which one is bigger.\n\nSo, let me denote A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(44) and B = sqrt(16) + sqrt(43). I need to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square both A and B, the squares will be:\n\nA² = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(44))² = 14 + 44 + 2*sqrt(14*44) = 58 + 2*sqrt(616)\nB² = (sqrt(16) + sqrt(43))² = 16 + 43 + 2*sqrt(16*43) = 59 + 2*sqrt(688)\n\nOkay, so now I have A² = 58 + 2*sqrt(616) and B² = 59 + 2*sqrt(688). Hmm, to compare A and B, it's sufficient to compare A² and B² because if A² > B², then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's compute the numerical values of A² and B² to see which one is larger.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(616). Let me calculate that. 616 is between 24²=576 and 25²=625. So sqrt(616) is approximately 24.8. Let me check with a calculator: 24.8² = 24*24 + 24*0.8 + 0.8*24 + 0.8² = 576 + 19.2 + 19.2 + 0.64 = 615.04. So, 24.8² = 615.04, which is just a bit less than 616. So sqrt(616) is approximately 24.8 + (616 - 615.04)/(2*24.8). The difference is 0.96, so 0.96/(49.6) ≈ 0.019. So sqrt(616) ≈ 24.819.\n\nThen, 2*sqrt(616) ≈ 2*24.819 ≈ 49.638.\n\nTherefore, A² = 58 + 49.638 ≈ 107.638.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(688). Similarly, 688 is between 26²=676 and 27²=729. So sqrt(688) is between 26 and 27.\n\nLet's compute 26.2² = 26² + 2*26*0.2 + 0.2² = 676 + 10.4 + 0.04 = 686.44. So, 26.2² = 686.44, which is still less than 688. The difference is 688 - 686.44 = 1.56. So, we can approximate sqrt(688) as 26.2 + 1.56/(2*26.2) = 26.2 + 1.56/52.4 ≈ 26.2 + 0.03 ≈ 26.23.\n\nSo, sqrt(688) ≈ 26.23, which makes 2*sqrt(688) ≈ 52.46.\n\nTherefore, B² = 59 + 52.46 ≈ 111.46.\n\nNow, comparing A² ≈ 107.638 and B² ≈ 111.46. Clearly, 111.46 is larger than 107.638. Therefore, B² > A², which implies that B > A.\n\nSo, sqrt(16) + sqrt(43) is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(44). Therefore, B is larger, and the answer is sqrt(16) + sqrt(43).\n\nWait, hold on, let me verify my calculations because sometimes approximations can lead to errors.\n\nFirst, let me double-check sqrt(616):\n\n24.8² = 615.04, so sqrt(616) ≈ 24.8 + (616 - 615.04)/(2*24.8) = 24.8 + 0.96/49.6 ≈ 24.8 + 0.019 ≈ 24.819. So 2*sqrt(616) ≈ 49.638. Then A² = 58 + 49.638 ≈ 107.638.\n\nNow, sqrt(688):\n\n26.2² = 686.44, so sqrt(688) ≈ 26.2 + (688 - 686.44)/(2*26.2) = 26.2 + 1.56/52.4 ≈ 26.2 + 0.03 ≈ 26.23. So 2*sqrt(688) ≈ 52.46. Then B² = 59 + 52.46 ≈ 111.46.\n\nSo, yes, B² is larger. So, sqrt(16) + sqrt(43) is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(44).\n\nAlternatively, another method could be to consider the difference between the two expressions.\n\nLet me denote C = B - A = [sqrt(16) + sqrt(43)] - [sqrt(14) + sqrt(44)].\n\nIf I can show that C > 0, then B > A.\n\nSo, C = sqrt(16) - sqrt(14) + sqrt(43) - sqrt(44).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(16) - sqrt(14) = 4 - sqrt(14). Similarly, sqrt(43) - sqrt(44) = sqrt(43) - sqrt(44).\n\nNow, sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417, so 4 - 3.7417 ≈ 0.2583.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(43) ≈ 6.5574, sqrt(44) ≈ 6.6332, so sqrt(43) - sqrt(44) ≈ -0.0758.\n\nTherefore, C ≈ 0.2583 - 0.0758 ≈ 0.1825, which is positive. So, C > 0, which means B > A.\n\nThus, sqrt(16) + sqrt(43) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to use the concept that for positive numbers, the function f(x) = sqrt(x) is concave. Therefore, by the concavity of sqrt, we have that for positive weights, the weighted average is less than or equal to the function at the weighted average.\n\nBut I think the squaring method is straightforward and gives a clear answer.\n\nWait, let me try another way. Perhaps I can express both A and B as sums of square roots and then compare them numerically. Since the numbers inside the square roots are not too big, I can compute sqrt(14), sqrt(44), sqrt(16), sqrt(43) numerically and add them up.\n\nSo, sqrt(14): 14 is between 9 and 16, so sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417.\n\nsqrt(44): 44 is between 36 and 49, so sqrt(44) ≈ 6.6332.\n\nsqrt(16): 16 is perfect square, so sqrt(16) = 4.\n\nsqrt(43): 43 is between 36 and 49, so sqrt(43) ≈ 6.5574.\n\nNow, let's compute A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(44) ≈ 3.7417 + 6.6332 ≈ 10.3749.\n\nCompute B = sqrt(16) + sqrt(43) ≈ 4 + 6.5"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) and sqrt(27) + sqrt(40). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can calculate the approximate values of each square root and then add them up. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to manipulate these expressions algebraically to see which one is larger without calculating the exact decimals. Let me explore both options.\n\nFirst, let me try the approximate method. I know that sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623 because 3.1623 squared is 10. Then, sqrt(48) is about 6.9282, since 6.9282 squared is 48. So, adding those together, 3.1623 + 6.9282 is approximately 10.0905.\n\nNow, sqrt(27) is roughly 5.1961, and sqrt(40) is approximately 6.3246. Adding those gives 5.1961 + 6.3246, which is around 11.5207.\n\nComparing the two sums, 10.0905 vs. 11.5207, it seems like the second expression is larger. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nCalculating sqrt(10): 3.1623 squared is indeed 10, so that's correct. Sqrt(48): 6.9282 squared, let me verify that. 6.9282 * 6.9282: Let's do 6 * 6 = 36, 6 * 0.9282 = 5.5692, 0.9282 * 6 = 5.5692, and 0.9282 * 0.9282 ≈ 0.8618. Now adding all together: 36 + 5.5692 + 5.5692 + 0.8618 ≈ 48.0. So yes, sqrt(48) is approximately 6.9282.\n\nAdding sqrt(10) and sqrt(48), I get 3.1623 + 6.9282 = 10.0905. Correct.\n\nNow, sqrt(27): 5.1961 squared is 27, because 5^2 is 25 and 0.1961^2 is negligible, so yeah, 5.1961 is correct. Sqrt(40): 6.3246 squared is 40. Let me verify that as well. 6 squared is 36, 6 * 0.3246 = 1.9476, 0.3246 * 6 = 1.9476, and 0.3246 squared ≈ 0.105. So adding all together: 36 + 1.9476 + 1.9476 + 0.105 ≈ 40. So, sqrt(40) is approximately 6.3246.\n\nAdding those gives 5.1961 + 6.3246 = 11.5207. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(27) + sqrt(40) is approximately 11.5207, which is larger than sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) ≈ 10.0905. So, the second expression is larger.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's an algebraic way to compare them without calculating the approximate decimals. Let me consider squaring both expressions to see which one is larger. That might help because squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, so if a and b are non-negative, then if a > b, a^2 > b^2.\n\nSo, let me denote A = sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) and B = sqrt(27) + sqrt(40). I need to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square both A and B, I can get expressions in terms of sqrt(10), sqrt(48), sqrt(27), sqrt(40). Let me compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(10) + sqrt(48))^2 = 10 + 48 + 2*sqrt(10*48) = 58 + 2*sqrt(480).\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(27) + sqrt(40))^2 = 27 + 40 + 2*sqrt(27*40) = 67 + 2*sqrt(1080).\n\nSo, A^2 = 58 + 2*sqrt(480), and B^2 = 67 + 2*sqrt(1080).\n\nNow, to compare A and B, it's equivalent to comparing A^2 and B^2 since both A and B are positive.\n\nSo, let's compute A^2 - B^2 = (58 + 2*sqrt(480)) - (67 + 2*sqrt(1080)) = (58 - 67) + 2*(sqrt(480) - sqrt(1080)) = (-9) + 2*(sqrt(480) - sqrt(1080)).\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 = -9 + 2*(sqrt(480) - sqrt(1080)).\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(480) and sqrt(1080). Maybe we can factor these to see if they relate to any of the original sqrt terms.\n\nsqrt(480): Let's factor 480. 480 = 16 * 30. So, sqrt(480) = sqrt(16*30) = 4*sqrt(30) ≈ 4*5.4772 ≈ 21.9088.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1080): Let's factor 1080. 1080 = 36 * 30. So, sqrt(1080) = sqrt(36*30) = 6*sqrt(30) ≈ 6*5.4772 ≈ 32.8632.\n\nSo, sqrt(480) ≈ 21.9088 and sqrt(1080) ≈ 32.8632.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(480) - sqrt(1080) ≈ 21.9088 - 32.8632 ≈ -10.9544.\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 ≈ -9 + 2*(-10.9544) ≈ -9 - 21.9088 ≈ -30.9088.\n\nWhich is negative, meaning that A^2 - B^2 < 0, so A^2 < B^2. Therefore, A < B.\n\nSo, sqrt(27) + sqrt(40) is larger than sqrt(10) + sqrt(48).\n\nWait, but the approximate decimal method gave me the same result. So, both methods confirm that B > A. Therefore, sqrt(27) + sqrt(40) is larger.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to compare them without squaring. Maybe by expressing each term in a different way or looking for a common structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compare sqrt(10) with sqrt(27) and sqrt(48) with sqrt(40). Let me see:\n\nsqrt(10) is about 3.16, sqrt(27) is about 5.196. So, sqrt(27) is definitely bigger.\n\nsqrt(48) is about 6.928, sqrt(40) is about 6.324. So, sqrt(48) is bigger than sqrt(40). Hmm.\n\nBut when you add them, you have sqrt(27) + sqrt(40) vs sqrt(10) + sqrt(48). So, sqrt(27) is larger, sqrt(48) is larger than sqrt(40), but the question is which sum is larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the differences. Let me compute the difference between sqrt(27) and sqrt(10): 5.196 - 3.1623 ≈ 2.0337.\n\nSimilarly, the difference between sqrt(48) and sqrt(40): 6.9282 - 6.3246 ≈ 0.6036.\n\nSo, sqrt(27) is about 2.0337 larger than sqrt(10),"

Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, squaring Expression A:\n\nA² = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(47))²\n\nUsing the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², this becomes:\n\nA² = (sqrt(8))² + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(47) + (sqrt(47))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(8))² = 8\n\n(sqrt(47))² = 47\n\nSo, A² = 8 + 2*sqrt(8*47) + 47\n\nLet me compute 8 + 47 first, which is 55. So now:\n\nA² = 55 + 2*sqrt(376)\n\nWait, hold on, 8*47 is... 8*40 is 320, and 8*7 is 56, so 320 + 56 is 376. Yep, that's right. So A² = 55 + 2*sqrt(376)\n\nNow, moving on to squaring Expression B:\n\nB² = (sqrt(35) + sqrt(44))²\n\nAgain, using the same formula:\n\nB² = (sqrt(35))² + 2*sqrt(35)*sqrt(44) + (sqrt(44))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(35))² = 35\n\n(sqrt(44))² = 44\n\nSo, B² = 35 + 2*sqrt(35*44) + 44\n\nAdding 35 and 44 first: 35 + 44 = 79. So:\n\nB² = 79 + 2*sqrt(1540)\n\nWait, 35*44 is 1540? Let me check: 35*40 is 1400, and 35*4 is 140, so 1400 + 140 is indeed 1540. Okay, so B² = 79 + 2*sqrt(1540)\n\nNow, to compare A² and B², I need to see which is larger: 55 + 2*sqrt(376) versus 79 + 2*sqrt(1540)\n\nHmm, okay. So, the constants are 55 vs. 79. 79 is bigger. Then, the other terms are 2*sqrt(376) vs. 2*sqrt(1540). Since sqrt(1540) is bigger than sqrt(376), the second term in B² is larger, but the constant term in B² is also larger.\n\nSo, which effect is stronger? The constant term or the sqrt term? Hmm, perhaps I should calculate both and see.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(376). Let me see, 19² is 361, and 20² is 400. So sqrt(376) is between 19 and 20. Let me approximate it.\n\n19² = 361\n\n376 - 361 = 15\n\nSo, sqrt(376) ≈ 19 + 15/(2*19) = 19 + 15/38 ≈ 19 + 0.3947 ≈ 19.3947\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1540). Let's see, 39² is 1521, and 40² is 1600. So sqrt(1540) is between 39 and 40.\n\n39² = 1521\n\n1540 - 1521 = 19\n\nSo, sqrt(1540) ≈ 39 + 19/(2*39) = 39 + 19/78 ≈ 39 + 0.2436 ≈ 39.2436\n\nOkay, so sqrt(376) ≈ 19.3947 and sqrt(1540) ≈ 39.2436\n\nNow, compute 2*sqrt(376) ≈ 2*19.3947 ≈ 38.7894\n\nAnd 2*sqrt(1540) ≈ 2*39.2436 ≈ 78.4872\n\nSo, let me write the approximate A² and B²:\n\nA² ≈ 55 + 38.7894 ≈ 55 + 38.7894 ≈ 93.7894\n\nB² ≈ 79 + 78.4872 ≈ 79 + 78.4872 ≈ 157.4872\n\nWait, hold on. So A² is approximately 93.7894, and B² is approximately 157.4872. Therefore, B² is significantly larger than A².\n\nBut wait, if B² is larger, that would mean B is larger than A, right? So, sqrt(35) + sqrt(44) is larger than sqrt(8) + sqrt(47). Hmm, but let me double-check because sometimes approximations can be misleading.\n\nWait, let me see. A² ≈ 93.7894 and B² ≈ 157.4872. So, B² is indeed larger, so B > A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if my approximations are accurate enough or if there's another way to compare without squaring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can pair the terms or see if one expression is always greater than the other.\n\nWait, another thought: sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) can sometimes be compared by seeing if a + b is greater or less than another pair. But in this case, both expressions have two square roots each, so maybe that approach won't help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the difference between the two expressions and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nLet me define D = B - A = sqrt(35) + sqrt(44) - sqrt(8) - sqrt(47)\n\nIf D > 0, then B > A, else A > B.\n\nBut computing D directly might be messy. Alternatively, maybe I can square D and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nWait, but squaring D would involve cross terms, which complicates things. So perhaps that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can estimate sqrt(35) + sqrt(44) and sqrt(8) + sqrt(47) more accurately.\n\nLet me try to compute sqrt(35) and sqrt(44) more precisely.\n\nsqrt(35):\n\nI know that 5² = 25, 6²=36, so sqrt(35) is between 5 and 6. Let's approximate it.\n\n5.9² = 34.81\n\n5.9² = 34.81\n\n5.9² = 34.81\n\n5.9² = 34.81\n\nWait, 5.9² = 34.81\n\n5.9² = 34.81\n\nSo, 5.9² = 34.81\n\n35 - 34.81 = 0.19\n\nSo, to approximate sqrt(35) using linear approximation:\n\nsqrt(35) ≈ sqrt(34.81) + (0.19)/(2*sqrt(34.81)) ≈ 5.9 + 0.19/(2*5.9) ≈ 5.9 + 0.19/11.8 ≈ 5.9 + 0.0161 ≈ 5.9161\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(44):\n\n44 is between 36 (6²) and 49 (7²). Let's compute.\n\n6.6² = 43.56\n\n6.7² = 44.89\n\nSo, sqrt(44) is between 6.6 and 6.7.\n\nCompute 6.6² = 43.56\n\n44 - 43.56 = 0.44\n\nSo, sqrt(44) ≈ 6.6 + 0.44/(2*6."

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(3) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(30) + sqrt(35) or vice versa. Hmm, okay. Maybe I can square both expressions to make it easier to compare? I remember that squaring can help eliminate the square roots, but I also have to be careful because squaring is not a straightforward operation when dealing with sums.\n\nLet me denote the first expression as A = sqrt(3) + sqrt(47) and the second as B = sqrt(30) + sqrt(35). I need to compare A and B. If I square both A and B, I can get A^2 and B^2 and then compare those.\n\nSo, let's compute A^2 first. That would be (sqrt(3) + sqrt(47))^2. Using the formula (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2, I can expand this.\n\nCalculating each term:\n- sqrt(3)^2 = 3\n- 2 * sqrt(3) * sqrt(47) = 2 * sqrt(3*47) = 2 * sqrt(141)\n- sqrt(47)^2 = 47\n\nSo, A^2 = 3 + 47 + 2*sqrt(141) = 50 + 2*sqrt(141)\n\nSimilarly, let's compute B^2. That's (sqrt(30) + sqrt(35))^2.\n\nAgain, using the same formula:\n- sqrt(30)^2 = 30\n- 2 * sqrt(30) * sqrt(35) = 2 * sqrt(30*35) = 2 * sqrt(1050)\n- sqrt(35)^2 = 35\n\nSo, B^2 = 30 + 35 + 2*sqrt(1050) = 65 + 2*sqrt(1050)\n\nNow, I have A^2 = 50 + 2*sqrt(141) and B^2 = 65 + 2*sqrt(1050). I need to figure out which one is larger.\n\nBut wait, these expressions still have square roots. Maybe I can compare A^2 and B^2 without calculating the exact values. Let me subtract A^2 from B^2 and see if the result is positive or negative.\n\nSo, B^2 - A^2 = (65 + 2*sqrt(1050)) - (50 + 2*sqrt(141)) = 65 - 50 + 2*(sqrt(1050) - sqrt(141)) = 15 + 2*(sqrt(1050) - sqrt(141))\n\nHmm, so if I can determine the sign of B^2 - A^2, that will tell me whether B^2 is greater than A^2 or not. Since B^2 - A^2 = 15 + 2*(sqrt(1050) - sqrt(141)), I need to see if sqrt(1050) - sqrt(141) is positive or negative.\n\nWell, sqrt(1050) is definitely larger than sqrt(141) because 1050 is larger than 141. So, sqrt(1050) - sqrt(141) is positive. Therefore, 2*(sqrt(1050) - sqrt(141)) is positive, and adding 15 keeps it positive. Therefore, B^2 - A^2 is positive, which implies that B^2 > A^2.\n\nSince A^2 < B^2, that means A < B. So, sqrt(3) + sqrt(47) is smaller than sqrt(30) + sqrt(35). Therefore, sqrt(30) + sqrt(35) is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, computing A^2:\n- sqrt(3)^2 = 3\n- sqrt(47)^2 = 47\n- 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(47) = 2*sqrt(141)\nTherefore, A^2 = 3 + 47 + 2*sqrt(141) = 50 + 2*sqrt(141). That looks correct.\n\nComputing B^2:\n- sqrt(30)^2 = 30\n- sqrt(35)^2 = 35\n- 2*sqrt(30)*sqrt(35) = 2*sqrt(1050)\nTherefore, B^2 = 30 + 35 + 2*sqrt(1050) = 65 + 2*sqrt(1050). That also looks correct.\n\nSubtracting A^2 from B^2:\n65 - 50 = 15\nsqrt(1050) - sqrt(141) is positive as 1050 > 141\nTherefore, 2*(sqrt(1050) - sqrt(141)) is positive\nHence, 15 + positive number is positive\nSo, B^2 > A^2, which implies B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(30) + sqrt(35) is larger. So, the answer is sqrt(30) + sqrt(35). I need to write this as \\boxed{\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{35}}.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approximate the values numerically to confirm.\n\nCalculating sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(47) ≈ 6.856. So, A ≈ 1.732 + 6.856 ≈ 8.588.\n\nCalculating sqrt(30) ≈ 5.477, sqrt(35) ≈ 5.916. So, B ≈ 5.477 + 5.916 ≈ 11.393.\n\nSo, 8.588 vs. 11.393. Definitely, 11.393 is larger. So, sqrt(30) + sqrt(35) is larger.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{35}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{47}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{35}\\), we can square both expressions and compare the results.\n\nLet \\(A = \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{47}\\) and \\(B = \\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{35}\\).\n\nFirst, we compute \\(A^2\\):\n\\[\nA^2 = (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{47})^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{47} + (\\sqrt{47})^2 = 3 + 47 + 2\\sqrt{141} = 50 + 2\\sqrt{141}\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute \\(B^2\\):\n\\[\nB^2 = (\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{35})^2 = (\\sqrt{30})^2 + 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{30} \\cdot \\sqrt{35} + (\\sqrt{35})^2 = 30 + 35 + 2\\sqrt{1050} = 65 + 2\\sqrt{1050}\n\\]\n\nWe then compare \\(B^2 - A^2\\):\n\\[\nB^2 - A^2 = (65 + 2\\sqrt{1050}) - (50 + 2\\sqrt{141}) = 15 + 2(\\sqrt{1050} - \\sqrt{141})\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{1050} > \\sqrt{141}\\), the term \\(2(\\sqrt{1050} - \\sqrt{141})\\) is positive.

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(11) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(17) + sqrt(34), or vice versa. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this without actually calculating the exact decimal values, which might be a bit tedious.\n\nFirst, maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare. That seems like a common strategy when dealing with square roots. So, if I let A = sqrt(11) + sqrt(39) and B = sqrt(17) + sqrt(34), then A squared would be (sqrt(11) + sqrt(39))² and B squared would be (sqrt(17) + sqrt(34))². Let me compute these.\n\nStarting with A squared:\nA² = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(39))² = (sqrt(11))² + 2*sqrt(11)*sqrt(39) + (sqrt(39))²\nCalculating each term:\n= 11 + 2*sqrt(11*39) + 39\nSimplify:\n= 11 + 39 + 2*sqrt(429)\n= 50 + 2*sqrt(429)\n\nOkay, so A squared is 50 + 2*sqrt(429). Now let me compute B squared:\nB² = (sqrt(17) + sqrt(34))² = (sqrt(17))² + 2*sqrt(17)*sqrt(34) + (sqrt(34))²\nCalculating each term:\n= 17 + 2*sqrt(17*34) + 34\nSimplify:\n= 17 + 34 + 2*sqrt(578)\n= 51 + 2*sqrt(578)\n\nSo, B squared is 51 + 2*sqrt(578). Now, to compare A² and B², I can subtract the smaller one from the larger one to see if the result is positive or negative.\n\nLet me compute A² - B²:\n= (50 + 2*sqrt(429)) - (51 + 2*sqrt(578))\n= 50 - 51 + 2*sqrt(429) - 2*sqrt(578)\n= -1 + 2*(sqrt(429) - sqrt(578))\n\nSo, A² - B² = -1 + 2*(sqrt(429) - sqrt(578)). Now, if sqrt(429) is less than sqrt(578), then sqrt(429) - sqrt(578) is negative, making the entire expression positive because we have -1 + 2*(negative number). Alternatively, if sqrt(429) is greater than sqrt(578), the expression would be negative. But wait, 429 is less than 578, right? Because 429 is 429 and 578 is 578. So, sqrt(429) is less than sqrt(578). Therefore, sqrt(429) - sqrt(578) is negative. So, 2*(sqrt(429) - sqrt(578)) is negative, and then -1 + negative makes it more negative. So, A² - B² is negative, meaning A² < B². Therefore, A < B.\n\nWait, hold on. If A² is less than B², that means A is less than B. So, sqrt(11) + sqrt(39) is less than sqrt(17) + sqrt(34). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(17) + sqrt(34). Hmm, let me verify that because sometimes when comparing square roots, the cross terms can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the difference between A and B. Let me compute A - B:\n\nA - B = sqrt(11) + sqrt(39) - sqrt(17) - sqrt(34). If I can show that this is negative, then A < B. But without knowing exact values, it's harder to see. Maybe squaring was a better approach because it gave me a clear answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my computations:\n\nFor A²:\n11 + 39 = 50, and 2*sqrt(429). That's correct.\n\nFor B²:\n17 + 34 = 51, and 2*sqrt(578). Correct.\n\nThen A² - B² = -1 + 2*(sqrt(429) - sqrt(578)). Since sqrt(429) - sqrt(578) is negative, 2*(negative) is negative, so -1 + negative is more negative. So, A² - B² is negative, meaning A² < B², so A < B.\n\nThus, sqrt(11) + sqrt(39) is less than sqrt(17) + sqrt(34). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(17) + sqrt(34). So, I need to write that in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, a is 17 and b is 34. Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(17) + sqrt(34).\n\nWait, but let me think again—that seems too straightforward. Is there another way to confirm? Maybe by approximating the values.\n\nCompute sqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166, sqrt(39) ≈ 6.2449, so A ≈ 3.3166 + 6.2449 ≈ 9.5615.\n\nCompute sqrt(17) ≈ 4.1231, sqrt(34) ≈ 5.8309, so B ≈ 4.1231 + 5.8309 ≈ 9.9540.\n\nSo, A ≈ 9.5615, B ≈ 9.9540. So, indeed, B is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if I square both:\n\nA² ≈ (9.5615)² ≈ 91.41\n\nB² ≈ (9.9540)² ≈ 99.08\n\nWhich is consistent with A² ≈ 50 + 2*sqrt(429) ≈ 50 + 2*20.7135 ≈ 50 + 41.427 ≈ 91.427, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, B² ≈ 51 + 2*sqrt(578) ≈ 51 + 2*24.0416 ≈ 51 + 48.083 ≈ 99.083, which also matches.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that B squared is larger, meaning B is larger than A. Therefore, sqrt(17) + sqrt(34) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(39).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about whether there's a different approach, maybe using inequalities or something else. Hmm, perhaps Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-QM?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) as something else. Hmm, but in this case, the cross terms in both A² and B² are positive, so it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I let x = sqrt(11) + sqrt(39), y = sqrt(17) + sqrt(34). Then, we can compute x² and y² as we did, and compare. So, that seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the difference between sqrt(17) + sqrt(34) and sqrt(11) + sqrt(39). Maybe not necessary, but just to see:\n\nCompute sqrt(34) - sqrt(39): sqrt(34) is about 5.830, sqrt(39) is about 6.2449. So, sqrt(34) - sqrt(39) ≈ -0.4149.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(17) - sqrt(11): sqrt(17) ≈ 4.1231, sqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166, so difference is about +0.8065.\n\nSo, overall, y = sqrt(17) + sqrt(34) is sqrt(17) + (sqrt(34)) and x is sqrt(11) + sqrt(39). So, we have a positive term (sqrt(17) - sqrt(11)) and a negative term (sqrt(34) - sqrt(39)). The positive term is about +0.8065 and the negative term is about -0.4149. So, total difference is about +0.3916, which is positive. So, y is larger.\n\nThis approximation method also confirms that y is larger than x.\n\nHence, I think that's pretty conclusive. So, the larger number is sqrt(17)"

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes when comparing sums of square roots, squaring both sides can help because it turns the square roots into numbers that are easier to handle. So maybe I can square both expressions and then compare them. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(46) and B = sqrt(21) + sqrt(43). So, I need to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square both A and B, I get:\n\nA² = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(46))² = 14 + 46 + 2*sqrt(14*46) = 60 + 2*sqrt(644)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB² = (sqrt(21) + sqrt(43))² = 21 + 43 + 2*sqrt(21*43) = 64 + 2*sqrt(903)\n\nSo now I have A² = 60 + 2*sqrt(644) and B² = 64 + 2*sqrt(903). Now I need to compare 60 + 2*sqrt(644) and 64 + 2*sqrt(903).\n\nHmm, it's still a bit complicated because of the square roots. Maybe I can calculate the approximate values of these square roots to get a better idea.\n\nFirst, let's compute sqrt(644). I know that 25² is 625 and 26² is 676, so sqrt(644) is somewhere between 25 and 26. Let me find a better approximation.\n\n25² = 625, so 644 - 625 = 19. So sqrt(644) = 25 + 19/(2*25) approximately, using the linear approximation. That would be 25 + 19/50 = 25 + 0.38 = 25.38. Is that a good enough approximation? Let me check.\n\n25.38² = (25 + 0.38)² = 25² + 2*25*0.38 + 0.38² = 625 + 19 + 0.1444 = 644.1444. That's very close to 644, so sqrt(644) ≈ 25.38. So, 2*sqrt(644) ≈ 50.76.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(903). Let's see, 30² is 900, so sqrt(903) is just a bit more than 30. Let me calculate it.\n\nUsing linear approximation again: sqrt(903) = sqrt(900 + 3) ≈ 30 + 3/(2*30) = 30 + 0.05 = 30.05.\n\nLet me check 30.05²: (30 + 0.05)² = 900 + 2*30*0.05 + 0.05² = 900 + 3 + 0.0025 = 903.0025. That's really close to 903. So sqrt(903) ≈ 30.05. Therefore, 2*sqrt(903) ≈ 60.10.\n\nSo now, plugging back into A² and B²:\n\nA² ≈ 60 + 50.76 = 110.76\n\nB² ≈ 64 + 60.10 = 124.10\n\nComparing 110.76 and 124.10, clearly B² is larger. Therefore, B is larger than A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my approximations. Because sometimes linear approximations can give a slightly off value, especially since sqrt(644) is 25.38 and sqrt(903) is 30.05.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the exact differences between A² and B².\n\nA² - B² = (60 + 2*sqrt(644)) - (64 + 2*sqrt(903)) = (60 - 64) + 2*(sqrt(644) - sqrt(903)) = (-4) + 2*(sqrt(644) - sqrt(903)).\n\nSo, is A² - B² positive or negative? Let's see:\n\nsqrt(644) ≈ 25.38, sqrt(903) ≈ 30.05. So sqrt(644) - sqrt(903) ≈ 25.38 - 30.05 ≈ -4.67.\n\nTherefore, 2*(sqrt(644) - sqrt(903)) ≈ 2*(-4.67) ≈ -9.34\n\nSo, A² - B² ≈ (-4) + (-9.34) ≈ -13.34\n\nWhich is negative, so A² < B², which means A < B. Therefore, sqrt(21) + sqrt(43) is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(46).\n\nWait, but let me verify this more precisely because my approximations might not be accurate enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can square A and B again but more accurately.\n\nLet me compute A² = 60 + 2*sqrt(644). Compute sqrt(644) more accurately.\n\n644 - 625 = 19. So sqrt(644) = sqrt(625 + 19). Using the binomial approximation, sqrt(a + b) ≈ sqrt(a) + b/(2*sqrt(a)).\n\nSo sqrt(625 + 19) ≈ 25 + 19/(2*25) = 25 + 0.38 = 25.38. As before. Now, let's compute 25.38²:\n\n25.38 * 25.38. Let's compute this step by step.\n\n25 * 25 = 625\n\n25 * 0.38 = 9.5\n\n0.38 * 25 = 9.5\n\n0.38 * 0.38 = 0.1444\n\nAdding up: 625 + 9.5 + 9.5 + 0.1444 = 625 + 19 + 0.1444 = 644.1444. So, as before, 25.38² = 644.1444.\n\nSo, sqrt(644) is approximately 25.38, but a bit less because 25.38² is 644.1444, which is 0.1444 more than 644. So, sqrt(644) ≈ 25.38 - 0.1444/(2*25.38) ≈ 25.38 - 0.00287 ≈ 25.377.\n\nSo, sqrt(644) ≈ 25.377. Therefore, 2*sqrt(644) ≈ 50.754.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(903). Let's compute this more accurately.\n\n903 is 900 + 3. So, sqrt(903) = sqrt(900 + 3) ≈ 30 + 3/(2*30) = 30 + 0.05 = 30.05.\n\nBut let's do a better approximation.\n\nCompute 30.05²: 30 + 0.05\n\n= 30² + 2*30*0.05 + 0.05² = 900 + 3 + 0.0025 = 903.0025.\n\nSo, 30.05² = 903.0025, which is just 0.0025 more than 903. So, sqrt(903) ≈ 30.05 - 0.0025/(2*30.05) ≈ 30.05 - 0.0000416 ≈ 30.049958.\n\nSo, sqrt(903) ≈ 30.049958.\n\nTherefore"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(3) + sqrt(46) and sqrt(13) + sqrt(17). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(3) + sqrt(46) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(17) or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help because it turns them into expressions that might be easier to compare.\n\nAlright, so let me denote A = sqrt(3) + sqrt(46) and B = sqrt(13) + sqrt(17). I want to see if A is greater than B or not. If I square both A and B, I can compare them more easily.\n\nStarting with A squared: A² = (sqrt(3) + sqrt(46))². Expanding this, it becomes (sqrt(3))² + 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(46) + (sqrt(46))². That simplifies to 3 + 2*sqrt(138) + 46. So, adding 3 and 46 gives 49, so A² = 49 + 2*sqrt(138).\n\nNow, let me square B as well: B² = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(17))². Expanding this, it becomes (sqrt(13))² + 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(17) + (sqrt(17))². Simplifying, that's 13 + 2*sqrt(221) + 17. Adding 13 and 17 gives 30, so B² = 30 + 2*sqrt(221).\n\nNow, to compare A² and B², let's calculate the numerical values of both. Starting with A²: 49 + 2*sqrt(138). I know that sqrt(138) is approximately sqrt(121) = 11 and sqrt(144) = 12, so sqrt(138) is somewhere around 11.75. Let me compute it more accurately. 11^2 = 121, 11.7^2 = 136.89, 11.75^2 = 138.06. So sqrt(138) ≈ 11.75 approximately. Therefore, A² ≈ 49 + 2*11.75 = 49 + 23.5 = 72.5.\n\nNow for B²: 30 + 2*sqrt(221). Let's calculate sqrt(221). 14^2 = 196, 15^2 = 225, so sqrt(221) is between 14 and 15. Let me compute 14.8^2: 14^2 + 2*14*0.8 + 0.8^2 = 196 + 22.4 + 0.64 = 219.04. That's still less than 221. 14.9^2: 14^2 + 2*14*0.9 + 0.9^2 = 196 + 25.2 + 0.81 = 222.01. So sqrt(221) is approximately 14.866. Therefore, B² ≈ 30 + 2*14.866 = 30 + 29.732 = 59.732.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems too low because B² is 59.732 and A² is 72.5. So that would mean A² is greater than B², which means A is greater than B. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can lead to errors.\n\nWait, sqrt(138): let me see, 11^2 = 121, 12^2 = 144. 138 is 17 more than 121, so sqrt(138) is 11 + 17/(2*11) approximately. Using the linear approximation: sqrt(x + delta) ≈ sqrt(x) + delta/(2*sqrt(x)). So sqrt(121 + 17) ≈ 11 + 17/(22) ≈ 11 + 0.772 ≈ 11.772. So my initial approximation of 11.75 was a bit low. Let me use 11.772.\n\nTherefore, A² ≈ 49 + 2*11.772 ≈ 49 + 23.544 ≈ 72.544.\n\nFor B²: sqrt(221). Let's do the same. sqrt(225) is 15, so 221 is 4 less. So sqrt(221) ≈ 15 - 4/(2*15) = 15 - 4/30 ≈ 15 - 0.133 ≈ 14.867. So that's more accurate. Therefore, B² ≈ 30 + 2*14.867 ≈ 30 + 29.734 ≈ 59.734.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 72.544 vs. B² ≈ 59.734. So indeed, A² is larger, which means A is larger than B. Therefore, sqrt(3) + sqrt(46) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(17).\n\nWait, hold on, before I conclude, let me verify this another way because sometimes squaring can sometimes give misleading results if the numbers are too big or too small. But in this case, both A and B are sums of two square roots each, so when squared, they become larger numbers, and the approximations seem to back up my conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to consider that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) is approximately equal to sqrt(a + b + 2*sqrt(ab)). So, if I compute sqrt(3 + 17 + 2*sqrt(51)) for A and sqrt(13 + 17 + 2*sqrt(221)) for B, this could give an approximate idea.\n\nWait, that might complicate more. Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the difference between the two. That is, compute A - B and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nSo, A - B = sqrt(3) + sqrt(46) - sqrt(13) - sqrt(17). Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can group terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the two differences: (sqrt(46) - sqrt(17)) and (sqrt(3) - sqrt(13)). If both differences are positive, then A - B is positive.\n\nSo, let's check: sqrt(46) - sqrt(17). sqrt(46) is approximately 6.782, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123. So 6.782 - 4.123 ≈ 2.659, which is positive.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(3) - sqrt(13). sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(13) ≈ 3.606. So 1.732 - 3.606 ≈ -1.874, which is negative.\n\nSo, A - B = (sqrt(46) - sqrt(17)) + (sqrt(3) - sqrt(13)) ≈ 2.659 - 1.874 ≈ 0.785, which is positive. Therefore, A - B is positive, meaning A is larger.\n\nThis seems to confirm my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to take both A and B and compute their approximate numerical values.\n\nCompute sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(46) ≈ 6.782. So A ≈ 1.732 + 6.782 ≈ 8.514.\n\nCompute sqrt(13) ≈ 3.606, sqrt(17) ≈ 4.123. So B ≈ 3.606 + 4.123 ≈ 7.729.\n\nTherefore, A ≈ 8.514 and B ≈ 7.729, so A is indeed larger.\n\nWait, so that's another way to confirm, by just adding the approximate square roots.\n\nSo, to recap: when I squared A and B, I found that A² ≈ 72.544 and B² ≈ 59.734, which clearly shows A is larger. Additionally, by comparing the individual differences in the square roots, A - B is positive, so A is larger. Also, adding the approximate square roots directly gives A > B.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that sqrt(3) + sqrt(4"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(9) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(13) + sqrt(27). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(9) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(13) + sqrt(27). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute sqrt(9) and sqrt(36). I remember that the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, sqrt(9) is 3 because 3*3 is 9. Similarly, sqrt(36) is 6 because 6*6 is 36. So, sqrt(9) + sqrt(36) is 3 + 6, which is 9. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(13) + sqrt(27). I know that 13 and 27 are not perfect squares, so their square roots won't be whole numbers. I need to find approximate values for these square roots to compare the two sums.\n\nStarting with sqrt(13). I remember that 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16, so sqrt(13) must be somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me see, 3.6 squared is 12.96, which is just a bit less than 13, and 3.7 squared is 13.69, which is a bit more than 13. So, sqrt(13) is approximately 3.6055.\n\nNext, sqrt(27). I know that 27 is 3 squared times 3, so sqrt(27) is sqrt(3^3) which is 3*sqrt(3). And since sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, multiplying that by 3 gives us about 5.196. Alternatively, I can also compute sqrt(27) directly. 5 squared is 25, 5.2 squared is 27.04, so sqrt(27) is approximately 5.196.\n\nSo, putting it together, sqrt(13) is approximately 3.6055 and sqrt(27) is approximately 5.196. Adding them together gives 3.6055 + 5.196, which equals approximately 8.8015.\n\nWait a second, that can't be right. Because 3.6055 + 5.196 should be around 8.8015, but the first expression was 9. So 9 is larger than approximately 8.8015. That suggests that sqrt(9) + sqrt(36) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(27). But let me double-check my calculations because approximations can sometimes lead to confusion.\n\nLet me verify sqrt(13) again. 3.6 squared is 12.96, which is less than 13, and 3.61 squared is 3.61*3.61. Let me compute that: 3*3 is 9, 3*0.61 is 1.83, 0.61*3 is another 1.83, and 0.61*0.61 is about 0.3721. Adding those up: 9 + 1.83 + 1.83 + 0.3721 = 13.0321. So, 3.61 squared is approximately 13.0321, which is slightly more than 13. So, sqrt(13) is approximately 3.6055, which I got earlier.\n\nNow, sqrt(27). 5.196 squared is approximately 27, as I calculated before. Let me confirm that: 5.196*5.196. Let's break it down: 5*5 is 25, 5*0.196 is 0.98, 0.196*5 is 0.98, and 0.196*0.196 is approximately 0.0384. Adding those up: 25 + 0.98 + 0.98 + 0.0384 = 26.9984, which is very close to 27. So, indeed, sqrt(27) is approximately 5.196.\n\nSo, adding sqrt(13) and sqrt(27) gives roughly 3.6055 + 5.196 = 8.8015. And sqrt(9) + sqrt(36) is 3 + 6 = 9. So, 9 is larger than 8.8015. Therefore, sqrt(9) + sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me think if there's another way to compare them without approximating. Maybe by squaring both expressions? Since both are sums of square roots, squaring them might make it easier to compare. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(9) + sqrt(36) = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nLet me denote B = sqrt(13) + sqrt(27).\n\nSo, if I square A: A^2 = (sqrt(9) + sqrt(36))^2 = 9 + 2*sqrt(9*36) + 36 = 9 + 2*sqrt(324) + 36.\n\nSince sqrt(324) is 18, so A^2 = 9 + 2*18 + 36 = 9 + 36 + 36 = 81.\n\nSo, A^2 is 81, which means A is sqrt(81) = 9, as we already know.\n\nNow, let's compute B^2: (sqrt(13) + sqrt(27))^2.\n\nUsing the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n\nSo, B^2 = (sqrt(13))^2 + 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(27) + (sqrt(27))^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(sqrt(13))^2 = 13,\n\n(sqrt(27))^2 = 27,\n\nand 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(27) = 2*sqrt(13*27).\n\nSo, let me compute 13 + 27 first: that's 40.\n\nNow, sqrt(13*27). Let's compute 13*27: 13*20 is 260, 13*7 is 91, so 260 + 91 = 351. So, sqrt(351).\n\nHmm, sqrt(351) is a bit tricky. Let me see if I can simplify that.\n\n351 divided by 9 is 39. So, sqrt(351) = sqrt(9*39) = 3*sqrt(39).\n\n39 is 13*3, which doesn't have any square factors besides 1, so sqrt(39) is irrational. So, sqrt(351) is 3*sqrt(39).\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(27) = 2*sqrt(351) = 2*3*sqrt(39) = 6*sqrt(39).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nB^2 = 13 + 27 + 6*sqrt(39) = 40 + 6*sqrt(39).\n\nNow, we need to compare A^2 which is 81 and B^2 which is 40 + 6*sqrt(39).\n\nSo, if 81 is greater than 40 + 6*sqrt(39), then A is greater than B, which is what we found earlier.\n\nLet me compute 40 + 6*sqrt(39) numerically to see if it's less than 81.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(39). 6^2 is 36, 6.2^2 is 38.44, 6.3^2 is 39.69. So, sqrt(39) is approximately 6.244998.\n\nSo, 6*sqrt(39) is approximately 6*6.244998 = 37.469988.\n\nAdding 40: 40 + 37.469988 = 77.469988.\n\nSo, B^2 is approximately 77.47, which is less than 81. Therefore, B^2 < A^2, which means B < A.\n\nThus, sqrt(9) + sqrt(36) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(27).\n\nSo, the answer is 9, which is sqrt(9) + sqrt(36). So, in the form"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(10) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(24) or the other way around. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably simplify the expressions if possible. Let's look at sqrt(49) first because that seems straightforward. sqrt(49) is 7, right? So, sqrt(10) + sqrt(49) simplifies to sqrt(10) + 7. That's easier to compare with the other expression.\n\nNow, let's look at the other expression: sqrt(13) + sqrt(24). Hmm, sqrt(24) can be simplified as well. Since 24 is 4 times 6, sqrt(24) is sqrt(4*6) which is 2*sqrt(6). So, sqrt(13) + sqrt(24) is sqrt(13) + 2*sqrt(6). That might be helpful later on.\n\nSo, now we have:\n- sqrt(10) + 7\n- sqrt(13) + 2*sqrt(6)\n\nI need to compare these two. Maybe I can approximate the values of each square root and then add them up?\n\nLet me write down the approximate values:\n\nsqrt(10): I know that sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(10) should be somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me recall, 3.16^2 is 9.98, which is almost 10. So, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.16.\n\nsqrt(13): Similarly, sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(13) is a bit higher. Let me calculate 3.6^2: 3.6*3.6 is 12.96, which is close to 13. So, sqrt(13) is approximately 3.605.\n\nsqrt(6): Hmm, sqrt(4) is 2 and sqrt(9) is 3, so sqrt(6) is between 2 and 3. 2.4^2 is 5.76, 2.5^2 is 6.25, so sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45.\n\nSo, sqrt(13) is about 3.605, sqrt(6) is about 2.45. Therefore, 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.90.\n\nNow, let's compute the two expressions:\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(10) + 7 ≈ 3.16 + 7 = 10.16\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(13) + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ 3.605 + 4.90 ≈ 8.505\n\nWait, so 10.16 is definitely larger than 8.505. So, sqrt(10) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(24).\n\nBut wait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check my approximations because sometimes when approximating, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, sqrt(10): 3.16 is correct because 3.16^2 = 9.9856, which is almost 10. So, that's accurate.\n\nsqrt(13): 3.605 is correct because 3.605^2 is approximately 13.000. Let me check: 3.605 * 3.605. 3*3 is 9, 3*0.605 is 1.815, 0.605*3 is another 1.815, and 0.605*0.605 is about 0.366. So, adding all together: 9 + 1.815 + 1.815 + 0.366 ≈ 13.0, which matches. So, that's correct.\n\nsqrt(6): 2.45 is correct because 2.45^2 is 6.0025, which is just a bit over 6, so that's accurate.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(6) is approximately 4.90, which is accurate as 2*2.45 is 4.90. Then, sqrt(13) + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ 3.605 + 4.90 ≈ 8.505. That seems correct.\n\nAdding 3.16 + 7 gives 10.16, which is way larger than 8.505. So, it seems my initial conclusion was correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way to compare these two without approximating? Maybe using some algebraic manipulation or inequalities.\n\nLet me think. I can consider the two expressions:\n\nA = sqrt(10) + sqrt(49) = sqrt(10) + 7\n\nB = sqrt(13) + sqrt(24) = sqrt(13) + 2*sqrt(6)\n\nI need to find which is larger, A or B.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute A - B:\n\nA - B = sqrt(10) + 7 - sqrt(13) - 2*sqrt(6)\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\nA - B = (sqrt(10) - sqrt(13)) + (7 - 2*sqrt(6))\n\nHmm, let's evaluate each part:\n\nFirst, sqrt(10) - sqrt(13): since sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16 and sqrt(13) ≈ 3.605, this difference is approximately -0.445.\n\nSecond, 7 - 2*sqrt(6): 2*sqrt(6) ≈ 4.90, so 7 - 4.90 = 2.10.\n\nSo, combining these two, A - B ≈ (-0.445) + (2.10) ≈ 1.655.\n\nWhich is positive, meaning A - B is positive, so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(10) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(24).\n\nBut just to ensure that this method is accurate, let me think if I can find a different approach without approximating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps square both expressions and compare the squares? But since A and B are sums, squaring them would give cross terms, which might complicate things, but let's try.\n\nCompute A^2: (sqrt(10) + 7)^2 = (sqrt(10))^2 + 2*sqrt(10)*7 + 7^2 = 10 + 14*sqrt(10) + 49 = 59 + 14*sqrt(10)\n\nCompute B^2: (sqrt(13) + 2*sqrt(6))^2 = (sqrt(13))^2 + 2*sqrt(13)*2*sqrt(6) + (2*sqrt(6))^2 = 13 + 4*sqrt(78) + 24 = 37 + 4*sqrt(78)\n\nNow, let's compare A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 ≈ 59 + 14*3.162 ≈ 59 + 14*3.162 ≈ 59 + 44.268 ≈ 103.268\n\nB^2 ≈ 37 + 4*sqrt(78) ≈ 37 + 4*8.832 ≈ 37 + 35.328 ≈ 72.328\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 103.268, which is greater than B^2 ≈ 72.328. Therefore, A > B.\n\nTherefore, this method also confirms that sqrt(10) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(24).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that sqrt(10) is a smaller number than sqrt(13), but sqrt(49) is 7, which is a large number. So, the addition of sqrt(49) to sqrt(10) would dominate the other expression which has sqrt(24) and sqrt(13).\n\nWait, sqrt(24) is about 4.9, and sqrt(13) is about 3.6. So, 4.9 + 3.6 is 8.5, whereas sqrt(10) is 3.16, so 3.16 + 7 is 10.16, which is significantly larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this in terms of distance on the number line. If I have two points: one at sqrt(10) + 7 and another at sqrt(13) + 2*sqrt(6). Since"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to compare sqrt(4) + sqrt(48) and sqrt(35) + sqrt(38). Hmm, okay, let me see. First, I should probably simplify each square root as much as possible to see if that makes the comparison easier. \n\nStarting with sqrt(4), that's straightforward. I know that sqrt(4) is 2 because 2 squared is 4. So, sqrt(4) is just 2. Easy enough.\n\nNow, moving on to sqrt(48). That's a bit trickier, but I can break it down into smaller square roots that are easier to handle. 48 can be factored into 16 and 3 because 16 times 3 is 48.

I remember that the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, so sqrt(16*3) is sqrt(16) times sqrt(3). \n\nCalculating those, sqrt(16) is 4, so that simplifies to 4*sqrt(3). Okay, so sqrt(48) is 4*sqrt(3). That makes things a bit clearer. \n\nNow, let me rewrite both expressions with these simplified forms. The first expression is sqrt(4) + sqrt(48), which is 2 + 4*sqrt(3). The second expression is sqrt(35) + sqrt(38). These don't seem to factor as nicely, so I might have to leave them as they are for the comparison.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nFirst expression: 2 + 4*sqrt(3)\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(35) + sqrt(38)\n\nNow, I need to figure out which of these two sums is larger. Comparing these directly might not be straightforward, so maybe I should compute approximate decimal values for each and then compare them.\n\nAlright, let's start with the first expression: 2 + 4*sqrt(3)\n\nI know that sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So, 4*sqrt(3) would be 4 * 1.732. Let me do that multiplication:\n\n4 * 1.732 = 6.928\n\nSo, 4*sqrt(3) is approximately 6.928. Adding this to 2, we get:\n\n2 + 6.928 = 8.928\n\nSo, the first expression is approximately 8.928.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second expression: sqrt(35) + sqrt(38)\n\nAgain, I can approximate sqrt(35) and sqrt(38) individually.\n\nStarting with sqrt(35). I know that 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36, so sqrt(35) is just a little less than 6. Let me try to approximate it.\n\nI can note that 5.9 squared is 34.81, which is very close to 35. So, 5.9 squared is 34.81, which is just a bit less than 35. So, sqrt(35) is approximately 5.916. I remember that sqrt(36) is exactly 6, so sqrt(35) must be a little less than that.\n\nAlternatively, to be more precise, I can use linear approximation. The derivative of sqrt(x) is (1)/(2*sqrt(x)). So, at x=36, the derivative is 1/(2*6) = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833.\n\nSo, sqrt(35) ≈ sqrt(36) - (36 - 35)*0.0833 ≈ 6 - 1*0.0833 ≈ 5.9167.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(35) ≈ 5.9167.\n\nNext, sqrt(38). Similarly, I know that 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(38) is between 6 and 7. Let me see how close it is.\n\n6.1 squared is 37.21, which is still less than 38. 6.2 squared is 38.44, which is a bit more than 38. So, sqrt(38) is between 6.1 and 6.2.\n\nLet me try 6.15 squared: 6.15^2 = (6 + 0.15)^2 = 36 + 2*6*0.15 + 0.15^2 = 36 + 1.8 + 0.0225 = 37.8225. Still less than 38.\n\n6.16 squared: Let me calculate that. 6.16^2 = (6 + 0.16)^2 = 36 + 2*6*0.16 + 0.16^2 = 36 + 1.92 + 0.0256 = 37.9456. Still under 38.\n\n6.17 squared: 6.17^2 = (6 + 0.17)^2 = 36 + 2*6*0.17 + 0.17^2 = 36 + 2.04 + 0.0289 = 38.0689. That's just over 38.\n\nSo, sqrt(38) is between 6.16 and 6.17.\n\nTo approximate it more accurately, let's try 6.16 + (38 - 37.9456)/(38.0689 - 37.9456). Hmm, let's compute the numerator and denominator.\n\nThe numerator is 38 - 37.9456 = 0.0544.\n\nThe denominator is 38.0689 - 37.9456 = 0.1233.\n\nSo, the fraction is 0.0544 / 0.1233 ≈ 0.441.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(38) ≈ 6.16 + 0.441*(0.01) ≈ 6.16 + 0.00441 ≈ 6.16441.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The delta x is 0.1233, and the delta y is 0.0544. The slope is dy/dx ≈ 0.0544 / 0.1233 ≈ 0.441.\n\nSo, to estimate sqrt(38) which is 38 - 37.9456 = 0.0544 above 37.9456, the corresponding increase in x is approximately delta_x = delta_y / (dy/dx) = 0.0544 / 0.441 ≈ 0.123.\n\nSo, sqrt(38) ≈ 6.16 + 0.123 ≈ 6.283.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 6.17 squared is 38.0689, which is just over 38, so sqrt(38) should be just a bit less than 6.17, maybe around 6.165.\n\nWait, maybe I should use linear approximation more carefully.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = sqrt(x). Then, f'(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)).\n\nWe know that f(36) = 6, f(38) is between 6 and 7. Let me take x0 = 36, f(x0) = 6, f'(x0) = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833.\n\nWe want f(38). The difference is 38 - 36 = 2. So, using linear approximation:\n\nf(38) ≈ f(36) + f'(36)*(38 - 36) = 6 + (1/12)*2 = 6 + (2/12) = 6 + (1/6) ≈ 6.1667.\n\nHmm, so that's 6.1667. But that's an overestimate because the function is concave down (second derivative is negative), so the linear approximation will be above the actual function.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approximation is needed. Alternatively, I can use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate sqrt(38).\n\nStarting with an initial guess x0 = 6.1667.\n\nCompute f(x0) = sqrt(38) ≈ 6.1655.\n\nWait, that's actually very close to the actual value. Maybe I should just accept that sqrt(38) is approximately 6.1644.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 6.1644 squared:\n\n6.1644^2 = (6 + 0.16"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(9) + sqrt(18) and sqrt(15) + sqrt(16). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(9) + sqrt(18) and sqrt(15) + sqrt(16), and figure out which one is larger. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me simplify each of the square roots as much as possible. Starting with sqrt(9), that's straightforward because 9 is a perfect square. So sqrt(9) is 3. That part is easy.\n\nNext, sqrt(18) is a bit trickier. I know that 18 can be broken down into 9 times 2, and since 9 is a perfect square, I can take that out of the square root. So sqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2), which is sqrt(9)*sqrt(2), and that simplifies to 3*sqrt(2). So sqrt(18) is 3 times the square root of 2.\n\nNow, let me write out the first expression, sqrt(9) + sqrt(18), substituting the simplified values. That becomes 3 + 3*sqrt(2). So the first expression simplifies to 3 plus 3 times the square root of 2.\n\nMoving on to the second expression, sqrt(15) + sqrt(16). Let me tackle each term separately. Starting with sqrt(15), I don't think 15 can be broken down into a perfect square times another number, because 15 is 3*5. Neither 3 nor 5 is a perfect square, so sqrt(15) remains as it is. I'll just leave it as sqrt(15).\n\nNow, sqrt(16) is straightforward since 16 is a perfect square. 16 is 4 squared, so sqrt(16) is 4. Therefore, the second expression simplifies to sqrt(15) + 4.\n\nSo now, my two expressions are:\n1. 3 + 3*sqrt(2)\n2. 4 + sqrt(15)\n\nI need to figure out which one is larger. To do that, maybe I can subtract one from the other and see if the result is positive or negative. Let's try that.\n\nLet me denote A as the first expression: A = 3 + 3*sqrt(2)\nAnd B as the second expression: B = 4 + sqrt(15)\n\nSo, I want to find A - B. That would be (3 + 3*sqrt(2)) - (4 + sqrt(15)). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract the constants: 3 - 4 = -1\nThen, subtract the square roots: 3*sqrt(2) - sqrt(15)\nSo, putting it together, A - B = (-1) + (3*sqrt(2) - sqrt(15))\n\nNow, I need to figure out if this value is positive or negative. If it's positive, then A is larger; if it's negative, then B is larger.\n\nLooking at the terms, 3*sqrt(2) and sqrt(15). Let me approximate their values to see which one is bigger.\n\nI know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142. So, 3*sqrt(2) is roughly 3*1.4142 = 4.2426.\n\nOn the other hand, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298. So, sqrt(15) is about 3.873.\n\nSo, 3*sqrt(2) is approximately 4.2426, and sqrt(15) is approximately 3.873. Therefore, 3*sqrt(2) - sqrt(15) is approximately 4.2426 - 3.873, which is about 0.3696.\n\nSo, substituting back into A - B: (-1) + 0.3696 is approximately -0.6304.\n\nWhich is negative. That means A - B is negative, so A is less than B.\n\nWait, hold on, no. That can't be right because when I subtract A - B, a negative result would mean B > A.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit counterintuitive.\n\nWait, so A - B is (-1) + (3*sqrt(2) - sqrt(15)) ≈ (-1) + (4.2426 - 3.87298) ≈ (-1) + (0.3696) ≈ -0.6304.\n\nSo, that's negative, which means A is less than B.\n\nBut let me think about the numerical values.\n\nA is 3 + 3*sqrt(2) ≈ 3 + 4.2426 ≈ 7.2426\n\nB is 4 + sqrt(15) ≈ 4 + 3.87298 ≈ 7.87298\n\nComparing 7.2426 and 7.87298, clearly 7.87298 is larger than 7.2426.\n\nSo, that would mean B is larger.\n\nWait, but I thought A - B was negative, but B is indeed larger.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nBut let me verify my earlier step when I subtracted A - B.\n\nI had A = 3 + 3*sqrt(2)\n\nB = 4 + sqrt(15)\n\nSo, A - B = (3 - 4) + (3*sqrt(2) - sqrt(15)) = (-1) + (4.2426 - 3.87298) = (-1) + 0.3696 ≈ -0.6304.\n\nYes, that's correct. So A - B is negative, so B is larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(15) + sqrt(16) is larger than sqrt(9) + sqrt(18).\n\nBut let me just think again about this because sometimes when dealing with square roots, intuition can fail.\n\nSo, sqrt(9) is 3, which is a nice number. sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2), which is approximately 4.2426, so 3 + 4.2426 is about 7.2426.\n\nOn the other side, sqrt(15) is about 3.87298, and sqrt(16) is 4, so adding them together gives approximately 7.87298.\n\nYes, 7.87298 is definitely larger than 7.2426.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(15) + sqrt(16). So, I need to write that in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), so a is 15 and b is 16.\n\nI don't think I can combine these terms or simplify them further because 15 and 16 are not perfect squares. So, the answer is sqrt(15) + sqrt(16).\n\nAlternatively, if I want to write it as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) with a and b positive integers, then 15 and 16 are suitable.\n\nSo, in conclusion, sqrt(15) + sqrt(16) is larger than sqrt(9) + sqrt(18).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{16}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{9} + \\sqrt{18}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{16}\\), we start by simplifying each term.\n\nFirst, we simplify \\(\\sqrt{9}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{18}\\):\n- \\(\\sqrt{9} = 3\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\nThus, the expression \\(\\sqrt{9} + \\sqrt{18}\\) simplifies to:\n\\[ 3 + 3\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nNext, we simplify \\(\\sqrt{15}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{16}\\):\n- \\(\\sqrt{15}\\) remains as it is.\n- \\(\\sqrt{16} = 4\\)\n\nThus, the expression \\(\\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{16}\\) simplifies to:\n\\[ 4 + \\sqrt{15} \\]\n\nWe now compare the two simplified expressions:\n- The first expression is \\(3 + 3\\sqrt{2}\\).\n- The second expression is \\(4 + \\sqrt{15}\\).\n\nTo determine which is larger, we subtract the first expression from the second:\n\\[ (4 + \\sqrt{15}) - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2}) = 1 + \\sqrt{15} - 3\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nApproximating the values:\n- \\(3\\sqrt{2} \\approx 4.2426\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.87298\\)\n\nThus:\n\\[ 1 + 3.87298 - 4.2426 \\approx 1 - 0.3696 = -0.3696 \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, the second expression is larger.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(45) and sqrt(11) + sqrt(18). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two sums involving square roots: sqrt(7) + sqrt(45) and sqrt(11) + sqrt(18). The goal is to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes it's helpful to simplify them or find a way to approximate their values. Since square roots can't really be simplified here because 7, 45, 11, and 18 aren't perfect squares, I might need to compute their approximate decimal values to compare them.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a smarter way without approximating? I recall that sometimes you can compare the squares of the sums to determine which one is larger. If I square both expressions, I can compare the results and see which one is bigger without having to deal with square roots directly. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet's denote A = sqrt(7) + sqrt(45) and B = sqrt(11) + sqrt(18). I want to compute A² and B² and then compare them.\n\nStarting with A²:\nA² = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(45))²\nI know that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so applying that here:\nA² = (sqrt(7))² + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(45) + (sqrt(45))²\nSimplify each term:\nA² = 7 + 2*sqrt(7*45) + 45\nCompute 7 + 45 first: 52\nSo now it's 52 + 2*sqrt(315)\nHmm, sqrt(315) – let me see if I can simplify that. 315 factors into 9*35, because 9*35 is 315. So sqrt(315) is sqrt(9*35) which is 3*sqrt(35). So:\nA² = 52 + 2*(3*sqrt(35)) = 52 + 6*sqrt(35)\n\nOkay, now let's compute B² as well:\nB² = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(18))²\nAgain, using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²:\nB² = (sqrt(11))² + 2*sqrt(11)*sqrt(18) + (sqrt(18))²\nSimplify each term:\nB² = 11 + 2*sqrt(11*18) + 18\nAdd 11 and 18: 29\nSo now it's 29 + 2*sqrt(198)\nSimilarly, sqrt(198) can be simplified. 198 factors into 9*22, because 9*22 is 198. So sqrt(198) is sqrt(9*22) which is 3*sqrt(22). Therefore:\nB² = 29 + 2*(3*sqrt(22)) = 29 + 6*sqrt(22)\n\nAlright, so now I have:\nA² = 52 + 6*sqrt(35)\nB² = 29 + 6*sqrt(22)\n\nTo compare A² and B², I can subtract B² from A² to see if the result is positive or negative. If A² - B² is positive, then A² > B² and A > B. If it's negative, then A < B. Let's compute A² - B²:\n\nA² - B² = (52 + 6*sqrt(35)) - (29 + 6*sqrt(22))\nSimplify:\n52 - 29 = 23\n6*sqrt(35) - 6*sqrt(22) remains as is.\n\nSo A² - B² = 23 + 6*(sqrt(35) - sqrt(22))\n\nHmm, now I need to figure out if 23 + 6*(sqrt(35) - sqrt(22)) is positive or negative. Let me compute sqrt(35) and sqrt(22):\n\nsqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(35) is approximately 5.916, and sqrt(22) is approximately 4.690.\n\nSo sqrt(35) - sqrt(22) ≈ 5.916 - 4.690 ≈ 1.226\n\nMultiply that by 6: 1.226*6 ≈ 7.356\n\nSo now, A² - B² ≈ 23 + 7.356 ≈ 30.356\n\nWhich is definitely positive. Therefore, A² > B², so A > B.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems too straightforward. Is there a mistake here? Because I remember that sometimes when you approximate, you might get a slightly different result, but in this case, the approximation seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compare the terms before squaring. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose I have sqrt(7) + sqrt(45) vs sqrt(11) + sqrt(18). Maybe I can pair the terms or see if one is larger than the other.\n\nsqrt(45) is equal to sqrt(9*5) = 3*sqrt(5) ≈ 3*2.236 ≈ 6.708\n\nsqrt(7) ≈ 2.645\n\nSo sqrt(7) + sqrt(45) ≈ 2.645 + 6.708 ≈ 9.353\n\nNow, sqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2) = 3*sqrt(2) ≈ 3*1.414 ≈ 4.242\n\nsqrt(11) ≈ 3.316\n\nSo sqrt(11) + sqrt(18) ≈ 3.316 + 4.242 ≈ 7.558\n\nComparing 9.353 and 7.558, it's clear that sqrt(7) + sqrt(45) is larger.\n\nWait, so that approach is much simpler and gives the same result without having to deal with square roots. So that must be the way to go, actually. Instead of squaring, which introduces more complexity, just approximate the values.\n\nBut, just to double-check, why did the squared approach work? Because when you squared, you essentially compared the sums, but that's not a straightforward comparison because the cross terms (the sqrt(ab) terms) affect the result. So squaring can sometimes lead to inaccuracies if the terms aren't in a particular relation.\n\nHence, the pairing of the terms before squaring seems more reliable here.\n\nSo, just to recap, sqrt(45) is about 6.7, sqrt(7) is about 2.6, adding up to about 9.35. On the other side, sqrt(18) is about 4.2, sqrt(11) is about 3.3, adding up to about 7.55. Therefore, sqrt(7) + sqrt(45) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be precise, I could calculate sqrt(7) and sqrt(11) more accurately, and sqrt(18) and sqrt(45) as well, and then add them up. Let me try that.\n\nCompute sqrt(7):\nWe know that sqrt(4) = 2, sqrt(9) = 3, so sqrt(7) is between 2 and 3.\n\nCalculating it: 2.6457513110645906\n\nCompute sqrt(11):\nSimilarly, sqrt(9) = 3, sqrt(16) = 4, so sqrt(11) is between 3 and 4.\n\nCalculating it: 3.3166247903554\n\nCompute sqrt(18):\nsqrt(16) = 4, sqrt(25)=5, so sqrt(18) is between 4 and 5.\n\nCalculating it: 4.242640687119285\n\nCompute sqrt(45):\nsqrt(36) = 6, sqrt(49) =7, so sqrt(45) is between6 and7.\n\nCalculating it: 6.708203932590311\n\nNow, let's add sqrt(7) and sqrt(45):\n2.6457513110645906 + 6.708203932590311 ≈ 9.353955243654902\n\nNow, sqrt(11) and sqrt(18):\n3.3166247903554 + "

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(5) + sqrt(22) is bigger than sqrt(15) + sqrt(16), or vice versa. Hmm, both expressions have square roots, so maybe I can compare them by squaring both expressions?

To do that, I can square both expressions and then compare the squares. Remember, squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, so if A > B, then A² > B², and vice versa.\n\nSo, let me compute A² first:\n\nA² = (sqrt(5) + sqrt(22))²\n   = (sqrt(5))² + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(22) + (sqrt(22))²\n   = 5 + 2*sqrt(5*22) + 22\n   = 5 + 22 + 2*sqrt(110)\n   = 27 + 2*sqrt(110)\n\nNow, let's compute B²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(15) + sqrt(16))²\n   = (sqrt(15))² + 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(16) + (sqrt(16))²\n   = 15 + 2*sqrt(15*16) + 16\n   = 15 + 16 + 2*sqrt(240)\n   = 31 + 2*sqrt(240)\n\nOkay, so now I have A² = 27 + 2*sqrt(110) and B² = 31 + 2*sqrt(240).

Let me calculate both:\n\nFirst, let's approximate sqrt(110) and sqrt(240). I know that sqrt(100) is 10, so sqrt(110) should be a bit more than 10, maybe around 10.488. Similarly, sqrt(240) is a bit more than 15.4918.\n\nSo, let's approximate A²:\n\nA² ≈ 27 + 2*10.488 ≈ 27 + 20.976 ≈ 47.976\n\nB² ≈ 31 + 2*15.4918 ≈ 31 + 30.9836 ≈ 61.9836\n\nSo, A² is approximately 47.976 and B² is approximately 61.9836. Therefore, B² is larger than A², which means B is larger than A.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, if A² ≈ 48 and B² ≈ 62, then B is indeed larger. So, in that case, the larger number is sqrt(15) + sqrt(16). But let me verify it another way without approximating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare the two expressions without squaring. Let me see.\n\nExpression A: sqrt(5) + sqrt(22)\nExpression B: sqrt(15) + sqrt(16)\n\nI can write sqrt(16) as 4, so Expression B becomes sqrt(15) + 4.

Therefore, B - A is positive, so B > A.\n\nWait, so that's another way to see that B is larger. But in my first approach, when I approximated, I saw that B² was larger, which also implies that B is larger. So both methods confirm that B is larger.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check with another method. Maybe using inequalities.\n\nI know that for positive numbers, the square function is increasing, so if I can show that A² < B², that would imply A < B.\n\nWe already computed A² ≈ 47.976 and B² ≈ 61.9836, so A² < B², so A < B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?\n\nWait, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can pair the terms differently.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe group sqrt(5) + sqrt(16) and compare to sqrt(15) + sqrt(22). Hmm, sqrt(5) + sqrt(16) is sqrt(5) + 4, which is approximately 2.236 + 4 = 6.236. Similarly, sqrt(15) + sqrt(22) is approximately 3.872 + 4.690 = 8.562. So, 6.236 < 8.562, which again shows that B is larger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use vectors or something, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe consider the difference between B and A, and see if it's positive.\n\nAs I wrote earlier, B - A = sqrt(15) + sqrt(16) - sqrt(5) - sqrt(22). Let me compute each term:\n\nsqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, sqrt(16) = 4, sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, sqrt(22) ≈ 4.690.\n\nSo, 3.872 + 4 = 7.872, and 2.236 + 4.690 = 6.926.\n\nTherefore, 7.872 - 6.926 ≈ 0.946, which is positive. So, B - A is positive, so B is larger.\n\nWait, so both methods—squaring and direct comparison—lead me to conclude that B is larger. So, I think I can be confident that sqrt(15) + sqrt(16) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(22).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute more precise values.\n\nCompute sqrt(5): approximately 2.2360679775\n\nCompute sqrt(15): approximately 3.8729833462\n\nCompute sqrt(22): approximately 4.6904157598\n\nCompute sqrt(16): exactly 4.\n\nSo, Expression A: sqrt(5) + sqrt(22) ≈ 2.2360679775 + 4.6904157598 ≈ 6.9264837373\n\nExpression B: sqrt(15) + sqrt(16) ≈ 3.8729833462 + 4 ≈ 7.8729833462\n\nSo, Expression B is approximately 7.873, Expression A is approximately 6.926. Therefore, Expression B is larger.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(15) + sqrt(16).\n\nSo, the answer is sqrt(15) + sqrt(16), written in the form \\boxed{\\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{16}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{16}}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether \\(\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{22}\\) is larger than \\(\\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{16}\\), we can compare their squares.\n\nFirst, we compute the square of \\(\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{2"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(43) + sqrt(48) and sqrt(44) + sqrt(47). The goal is to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Both expressions involve two square roots added together. The numbers inside the square roots are consecutive numbers—43 and 48, 44 and 47. So, I wonder if there's a pattern or a relationship between these pairs that I can exploit.\n\nI remember that sometimes, when you have two terms that are close to each other, you can approximate them using linearization or something like that. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Maybe I should consider comparing the squares of both expressions instead. If I can find out which square is larger, that would tell me which original expression is larger.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(43) + sqrt(48) and B = sqrt(44) + sqrt(47). I want to compare A and B.\n\nSo, if I square both A and B, I can compare them directly.\n\nLet's compute A squared first:\n\nA² = (sqrt(43) + sqrt(48))² = (sqrt(43))² + 2*sqrt(43)*sqrt(48) + (sqrt(48))² = 43 + 2*sqrt(43*48) + 48.\n\nSimplifying that, 43 + 48 is 91, so A² = 91 + 2*sqrt(2064).\n\nWait, because 43*48 is 2064? Let me check that: 40*48 is 1920, plus 3*48 is 144, so 1920 + 144 is 2064. Yes, correct. So, A² = 91 + 2*sqrt(2064).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute B squared:\n\nB² = (sqrt(44) + sqrt(47))² = (sqrt(44))² + 2*sqrt(44)*sqrt(47) + (sqrt(47))² = 44 + 2*sqrt(44*47) + 47.\n\nSo, 44 + 47 is 91, so B² = 91 + 2*sqrt(2068).\n\nWait, 44*47 is... let's compute that. 40*47 is 1880, plus 4*47 is 188, so 1880 + 188 is 2068. Yep, so B² = 91 + 2*sqrt(2068).\n\nNow, comparing A² and B²: both have 91, so the difference comes from the terms with the square roots. Let me see which one is larger: sqrt(2064) or sqrt(2068).\n\nWell, sqrt(2068) is slightly larger than sqrt(2064) because 2068 is 4 more than 2064. So, 2*sqrt(2068) is slightly larger than 2*sqrt(2064). Therefore, B² is slightly larger than A², meaning B is slightly larger than A.\n\nWait, but is that accurate? Let me think again.\n\nActually, sqrt(2068) is sqrt(2064 + 4). So, the difference is small, but is 2*sqrt(2068) indeed larger than 2*sqrt(2064)? Yes, because sqrt is an increasing function. So, sqrt(2068) > sqrt(2064), so 2*sqrt(2068) > 2*sqrt(2064). Therefore, B² > A², so B > A. So, sqrt(44) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(43) + sqrt(48).\n\nBut wait, let me verify my calculations because sometimes when you approximate, you can get confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me consider that the function sqrt(x) is concave. Therefore, by the concavity of sqrt, we have that for x1 < x2, sqrt(x2) - sqrt(x1) is decreasing in x.\n\nWait, but in this case, we have two pairs: (43,48) and (44,47). So, maybe the difference between sqrt(48) - sqrt(43) is less than the difference between sqrt(47) - sqrt(44)? Is that the case?\n\nLet me compute sqrt(48) - sqrt(43) and sqrt(47) - sqrt(44). If sqrt(48) - sqrt(43) is less than sqrt(47) - sqrt(44), then the second pair has a smaller difference, so perhaps the sum is larger?\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because the differences are in different scales. Let me compute these differences numerically.\n\nCompute sqrt(43): sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(43) is approximately 6.557.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(48): since 6^2=36, 7^2=49, so sqrt(48) is approximately 6.928.\n\nSo, sqrt(48) - sqrt(43) ≈ 6.928 - 6.557 ≈ 0.371.\n\nNow, sqrt(44): sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(49)=7, so sqrt(44) is about 6.633.\n\nsqrt(47): sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(49)=7, so sqrt(47) is about 6.855.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(47) - sqrt(44) ≈ 6.855 - 6.633 ≈ 0.222.\n\nSo, the difference between sqrt(48) and sqrt(43) is approximately 0.371, while the difference between sqrt(47) and sqrt(44) is approximately 0.222. So, the first pair has a larger difference.\n\nBut since sqrt is concave, the function has diminishing returns, meaning that the increase in sqrt(x) is smaller as x increases. So, a larger step in x leads to a smaller increase in sqrt(x). Therefore, the larger difference in the first pair leads to a smaller increase in sqrt(x), meaning that sqrt(48) and sqrt(43) are further apart in their sqrt values.\n\nBut in our initial comparison, we saw that A² = 91 + 2*sqrt(2064) and B² = 91 + 2*sqrt(2068), so sqrt(2068) is a bit larger, so B² is a bit larger than A², which implies B is a bit larger than A.\n\nBut wait, in terms of the differences, I thought that the first pair has a larger difference, so the sqrt(48) - sqrt(43) is larger, but the increase in sqrt is smaller. So, the net effect is that sqrt(48) + sqrt(43) is less than sqrt(47) + sqrt(44). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach: instead of comparing A² and B², maybe compare A and B directly.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(43) + sqrt(48) and B = sqrt(44) + sqrt(47). Let me try to see if B - A is positive or negative.\n\nCompute B - A = sqrt(44) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(43) - sqrt(48).\n\nGroup terms: [sqrt(44) - sqrt(43)] + [sqrt(47) - sqrt(48)].\n\nCompute each bracket:\n\nsqrt(44) - sqrt(43): as before, approx 0.633 - 6.557? Wait no, wait sqrt(43) is about 6.557, sqrt(44) is about 6.633. So, sqrt(44) - sqrt(43) ≈ 0.076.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(47) - sqrt(48): sqrt(47) is about 6.855, sqrt(48) is about 6.928. So, sqrt(47) - sqrt(48) ≈ -0.073.\n\nTherefore, B - A ≈ 0.076 - 0.073 ≈ 0.003.\n\nSo, approximately, B is 0.003 larger than A. So, B > A.\n\nSo, that seems consistent with the earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write sqrt(44) + sqrt(47) as sqrt(44) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(43) + sqrt(48"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two sums of square roots: sqrt(26) + sqrt(48) and sqrt(28) + sqrt(38). The goal is to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that comparing square roots is tricky because they don't always behave like regular numbers. So, adding them together might not be straightforward either. Maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare? That sounds like a plan. I remember that squaring a sum isn't just the sum of squares because of the cross terms, so I'll have to be careful.\n\nLet me denote the first expression as A: A = sqrt(26) + sqrt(48). And the second expression as B: B = sqrt(28) + sqrt(38). I need to compare A and B.\n\nTo square A, I'll use the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So, A^2 = (sqrt(26))^2 + 2*sqrt(26)*sqrt(48) + (sqrt(48))^2. Similarly, B^2 = (sqrt(28))^2 + 2*sqrt(28)*sqrt(38) + (sqrt(38))^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFor A^2:\n- (sqrt(26))^2 = 26\n- (sqrt(48))^2 = 48\nSo, 26 + 48 = 74. Then, the cross term is 2*sqrt(26)*sqrt(48). Let me compute that: 2*sqrt(26*48). 26*48, let's see, 25*48 is 1200, and 1*48 is 48, so total is 1248. So, cross term is 2*sqrt(1248). I can compute sqrt(1248) if needed, but maybe I can factor it to simplify.\n\nSimilarly, for B^2:\n- (sqrt(28))^2 = 28\n- (sqrt(38))^2 = 38\nSo, 28 + 38 = 66. Cross term is 2*sqrt(28*38). 28*38: 20*38=760, 8*38=304, total is 760+304=1064. So, cross term is 2*sqrt(1064).\n\nSo, now A^2 = 74 + 2*sqrt(1248) and B^2 = 66 + 2*sqrt(1064).\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to compare A^2 and B^2. If A^2 > B^2, then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values of sqrt(1248) and sqrt(1064) to see which is larger.\n\nCalculating sqrt(1248): Well, 35^2 is 1225, so sqrt(1248) is a bit more than 35. Let me see, 35^2 = 1225, so 1248 - 1225 = 23. So, sqrt(1248) ≈ 35 + 23/(2*35) ≈ 35 + 23/70 ≈ 35 + 0.328 ≈ 35.328.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1064): 32^2 is 1024, so sqrt(1064) is a bit more than 32. 1064 - 1024 = 40, so sqrt(1064) ≈ 32 + 40/(2*32) ≈ 32 + 40/64 ≈ 32 + 0.625 ≈ 32.625.\n\nSo, sqrt(1248) ≈ 35.328 and sqrt(1064) ≈ 32.625.\n\nThen, 2*sqrt(1248) ≈ 2*35.328 ≈ 70.656 and 2*sqrt(1064) ≈ 2*32.625 ≈ 65.25.\n\nNow, plug these into A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 ≈ 74 + 70.656 ≈ 144.656\n\nB^2 ≈ 66 + 65.25 ≈ 131.25\n\nSo, 144.656 > 131.25, which implies A^2 > B^2, so A > B.\n\nWait, is that right? Because sqrt(1248) is much larger than sqrt(1064), so the cross terms are dominating, so A is larger.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check the approximate decimal values for sqrt(1248) and sqrt(1064) again.\n\nWait, 35^2=1225, so 1248-1225=23. So, 23/(2*35)=23/70≈0.32857. So, sqrt(1248)=35+0.32857≈35.32857.\n\nSimilarly, 32^2=1024, so 1064-1024=40. 40/(2*32)=40/64=0.625. So, sqrt(1064)=32+0.625=32.625.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, A^2≈144.656 and B^2≈131.25.\n\nThus, A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(26) + sqrt(48) is larger than sqrt(28) + sqrt(38).\n\nBut wait, just to make absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute the actual decimal values of A and B.\n\nLet me compute A: sqrt(26)≈5.099 and sqrt(48)≈6.928. So, A≈5.099+6.928≈12.027.\n\nComputing B: sqrt(28)≈5.291 and sqrt(38)≈6.164. So, B≈5.291+6.164≈11.455.\n\nSo, A is approximately 12.027, B is approximately 11.455, which confirms that A > B.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(26) + sqrt(48), which can be written as sqrt(26) + sqrt(48).\n\nBut wait, just to see if there is any other way to compare them without squaring? Maybe using some inequalities or properties of square roots.\n\nI remember that (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))^2 < (sqrt(a + b) + sqrt(a + b))^2, but that might not be helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference A - B and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nCompute A - B = sqrt(26) + sqrt(48) - sqrt(28) - sqrt(38). If this is positive, then A is larger.\n\nBut computing that directly might be difficult without a calculator. Maybe I can group terms.\n\nLet me write (sqrt(26) - sqrt(28)) + (sqrt(48) - sqrt(38)). If each of these differences is positive, then the sum would be positive overall.\n\nSo, let's see: sqrt(26) - sqrt(28). Since 26 < 28, sqrt(26) < sqrt(28), so this difference is negative.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(48) - sqrt(38). Since 48 > 38, sqrt(48) > sqrt(38), so this is positive.\n\nSo, it's a positive minus a negative? Or, rather, the second term is positive and the first is negative. So, whether the overall sum is positive or not depends on the magnitude of the negative term and the positive term.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute the absolute values and see.\n\nCompute |sqrt(26) - sqrt(28)| and |sqrt(48) - sqrt(38)|.\n\nCompute sqrt(28) - sqrt(26): sqrt(28)≈5.291, sqrt(26)≈5.099, difference≈0.192.\n\nCompute sqrt(48) - sqrt(38): sqrt(48)≈6.928, sqrt(38)≈6.164,"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(10) + sqrt(19) and sqrt(13) + sqrt(14). Hmm, okay. Both expressions involve square roots of numbers that are all in the range of 10 to 19. I remember that sometimes when you have square roots, you can compare them by squaring both sides, but I'm not sure if that will help here since they are being added together. \n\nLet me think. If I square both expressions, maybe I can compare the squares and see which one is larger. Let's try that. So, let me first compute (sqrt(10) + sqrt(19))². Expanding that, it should be 10 + 2*sqrt(10*19) + 19. That simplifies to 29 + 2*sqrt(190). Okay, got that.\n\nNow, let's do the same for (sqrt(13) + sqrt(14))². That would be 13 + 2*sqrt(13*14) + 14, which simplifies to 27 + 2*sqrt(182). Hmm, so now we have both expressions squared: 29 + 2*sqrt(190) and 27 + 2*sqrt(182). \n\nTo compare these, it's helpful to subtract the smaller one from the larger one. So, let's subtract 27 + 2*sqrt(182) from 29 + 2*sqrt(190). That gives us 2 + 2*sqrt(190) - 2*sqrt(182). Hmm, so this simplifies to 2 + 2*(sqrt(190) - sqrt(182)). \n\nI can factor out the 2, so that's 2*(1 + sqrt(190) - sqrt(182)). Now, I need to figure out if this is positive or negative. Since both sqrt(190) and sqrt(182) are positive, sqrt(190) - sqrt(182) is also positive. Let me approximate these square roots to see how much they differ.\n\nCalculating sqrt(182): Well, 13² is 169, and 14² is 196. So, sqrt(182) is between 13 and 14. Let's see: 13.5² is 182.25. Oh, wow, that's exactly 13.5². So, sqrt(182) is just a tiny bit less than 13.5, maybe about 13.48. Similarly, sqrt(190): 13² is 169, 14² is 196. Let's calculate 13.8²: 13.8*13.8. 13*13 is 169, 13*0.8 is 10.4, so 13.8*13.8 is 169 + 10.4 + 10.4 + 0.64, which is 169 + 20.8 + 0.64 = 190.44. So, 13.8² is 190.44, which is just a bit over 190. So, sqrt(190) is slightly less than 13.8, maybe around 13.79.\n\nSo, sqrt(190) is approximately 13.79, and sqrt(182) is approximately 13.48. Therefore, sqrt(190) - sqrt(182) is about 13.79 - 13.48, which is 0.31. So, going back to that expression: 2*(1 + 0.31) is 2*(1.31) = 2.62. So, the difference between (sqrt(10) + sqrt(19))² and (sqrt(13) + sqrt(14))² is about 2.62. \n\nSince this difference is positive, that means (sqrt(10) + sqrt(19))² is larger than (sqrt(13) + sqrt(14))². Therefore, the original expressions sqrt(10) + sqrt(19) must be larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(14). \n\nWait a second, just to make sure I didn't miscalculate the square roots. Let me verify sqrt(182) and sqrt(190). \n\nCalculating sqrt(182): 13.5² is 182.25, so sqrt(182) is indeed just a bit less than 13.5, which is 13.48. Similarly, 13.8² is 190.44, so sqrt(190) is just a bit less than 13.8, which is 13.79. So, the difference is about 0.31, and that's correct. \n\nTherefore, 2 + 2*(0.31) is 2.62, so the squared difference is 2.62. That's positive, so yes, the squared sum of sqrt(10) + sqrt(19) is larger. Therefore, sqrt(10) + sqrt(19) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(14).\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the actual numerical values to confirm.\n\nCalculating sqrt(10): that's approximately 3.1623.\n\nCalculating sqrt(19): that's approximately 4.3589.\n\nAdding them together: 3.1623 + 4.3589 is about 7.5212.\n\nNow, sqrt(13): approximately 3.6055.\n\nsqrt(14): approximately 3.7417.\n\nAdding them together: 3.6055 + 3.7417 is approximately 7.3472.\n\nSo, 7.5212 is greater than 7.3472, which confirms that sqrt(10) + sqrt(19) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the general principle, sometimes when you have two square roots being added, their sum can be compared by considering the differences in their radicands. In this case, sqrt(10) + sqrt(19) vs sqrt(13) + sqrt(14). Maybe there's a way to see which pair has a larger sum without computing the actual values.\n\nBut I think the method I used is solid. Squaring both expressions, calculating the differences, and comparing them. It's a standard approach when dealing with square roots.\n\nSo, in conclusion, sqrt(10) + sqrt(19) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(14).

So, sqrt(6) + sqrt(25) becomes sqrt(6) + 5. That's simpler to work with.\n\nNow, the second expression is sqrt(7) + sqrt(22). I don't think 22 is a perfect square, so I can't simplify that directly. So, I guess I need to figure out which of the two sums, sqrt(6) + 5 or sqrt(7) + sqrt(22), is larger.\n\nMaybe I should approximate the values numerically to get a sense of which one is bigger? That might be a good approach because it can help me compare them without getting bogged down in complicated algebra.\n\nAlright, let's start by approximating sqrt(6). I know that sqrt(4) is 2 and sqrt(9) is 3, so sqrt(6) must be somewhere between 2 and 3. Let me recall that sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449. Hmm, I can verify that on a calculator, but since I don't have one, I remember that 2.449 squared is about 6. So, that's correct.\n\nNext, sqrt(25) is 5, as I figured earlier.\n\nSo, sqrt(6) + 5 is approximately 2.449 + 5, which is 7.449.\n\nNow, let's tackle sqrt(7) + sqrt(22). I need to approximate these two square roots.\n\nStarting with sqrt(7). I know that sqrt(4) is 2 and sqrt(9) is 3, so sqrt(7) is between 2 and 3. Let me recall that sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458. I can verify that by squaring 2.6458: 2.6458 squared is roughly 7. So, that's correct.\n\nNext, sqrt(22). Hmm, sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(22) is between 4 and 5. Let me think: 4.6 squared is 21.16, and 4.7 squared is 22.09. So, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.690. Let me verify that: 4.690 squared is about 22, yes. So, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.690.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(7) + sqrt(22) is approximately 2.6458 + 4.690, which is about 7.335.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Earlier, sqrt(6) + 5 was approximately 7.449, and sqrt(7) + sqrt(22) is approximately 7.335. So, 7.449 is greater than 7.335, which means sqrt(6) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(7) + sqrt(22).\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, because approximations can sometimes be tricky.\n\nLet me double-check the square roots:\n\n- sqrt(6): 2.449, because 2.449^2 = 6.000001.\n- sqrt(25): 5.000000.\n- sqrt(7): 2.6458, because 2.6458^2 = 7.000000.\n- sqrt(22): 4.690, because 4.690^2 = 22.000000.\n\nSo, the approximations seem accurate.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n- sqrt(6) + 5 ≈ 2.449 + 5.000 = 7.449\n- sqrt(7) + sqrt(22) ≈ 2.6458 + 4.690 = 7.3358\n\nYes, 7.449 is definitely larger than 7.3358. So, sqrt(6) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(7) + sqrt(22).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider another approach without approximating. Perhaps I can square both expressions and compare them directly. That might provide a more precise answer without relying on decimal approximations.\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote:\n\nA = sqrt(6) + sqrt(25) = sqrt(6) + 5\nB = sqrt(7) + sqrt(22)\n\nI want to compare A and B. Let me compute A^2 and B^2 and see which one is larger.\n\nFirst, compute A^2:\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(6) + 5)^2 = (sqrt(6))^2 + 2 * sqrt(6) * 5 + 5^2 = 6 + 10 sqrt(6) + 25 = 31 + 10 sqrt(6)\n\nSimilarly, compute B^2:\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(22))^2 = (sqrt(7))^2 + 2 * sqrt(7) * sqrt(22) + (sqrt(22))^2 = 7 + 2 sqrt(154) + 22 = 29 + 2 sqrt(154)\n\nSo now, I have A^2 = 31 + 10 sqrt(6) and B^2 = 29 + 2 sqrt(154).\n\nTo compare A and B, I can compare A^2 and B^2 directly.\n\nSo, we need to compare 31 + 10 sqrt(6) and 29 + 2 sqrt(154).\n\nLet's subtract 29 from both sides to make it simpler:\n\n31 - 29 + 10 sqrt(6) vs. 2 sqrt(154)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2 + 10 sqrt(6) vs. 2 sqrt(154)\n\nSo, now, I need to see whether 2 + 10 sqrt(6) is greater than or less than 2 sqrt(154).\n\nTo make it easier, let's divide both sides by 2:\n\n1 + 5 sqrt(6) vs. sqrt(154)\n\nSo now, the question is: Is 1 + 5 sqrt(6) greater than sqrt(154)?\n\nIf yes, then A^2 > B^2, which implies A > B.\n\nIf no, then A^2 < B^2, meaning A < B.\n\nSo, let's compute 1 + 5 sqrt(6):\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(6). As before, sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449.\n\nSo, 5 sqrt(6) ≈ 5 * 2.449 ≈ 12.245.\n\nThen, adding 1: 1 + 12.245 ≈ 13.245.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(154):\n\nsqrt(154) is approximately... Let's see, 12^2 is 144, 13^2 is 169, so sqrt(154) is between 12 and 13. Let's compute 12.4^2: 12.4 * 12.4 = (12 + 0.4)^2 = 144 + 2*12*0.4 + 0.16 = 144 + 9.6 + 0.16 = 153.76. Wait a minute, that's very close to 154.\n\nSo, 12.4^2 = 153.76, which is just 0.24 less than 154. So, sqrt(154) is approximately 12.4 + (0.24)/(2*12.4) ≈ 12.4 + 0.0096 ≈ 12.4096. So, approximately 12.41.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(154) ≈ 12.41.\n\nSo, 1 + 5 sqrt(6) ≈13.245, and sqrt(154)≈12.41.\n\nSo, 13.245 > 12.41, which means that 1 + 5 sqrt(6) > sqrt(154).\n\nTherefore, 2 + 10 sqrt(6) > 2 sqrt(154), which means that A^2 > B^2.\n\nTherefore, A > B, so sqrt(6) + sqrt(2"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(11) + sqrt(34) is larger than sqrt(31) + sqrt(33), or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about the best way to compare these two sums.\n\nI remember that sometimes when dealing with square roots, squaring both expressions can help compare them more easily. Since both expressions are sums of square roots, maybe squaring them will make the comparison straightforward. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet’s denote:\n- A = sqrt(11) + sqrt(34)\n- B = sqrt(31) + sqrt(33)\n\nI want to compare A and B. If I square both, I can analyze which one is larger.\n\nFirst, let's compute A squared:\nA² = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(34))²\n     = (sqrt(11))² + 2*sqrt(11)*sqrt(34) + (sqrt(34))²\n     = 11 + 2*sqrt(11*34) + 34\n     = 45 + 2*sqrt(374)\n\nSimilarly, let's compute B squared:\nB² = (sqrt(31) + sqrt(33))²\n     = (sqrt(31))² + 2*sqrt(31)*sqrt(33) + (sqrt(33))²\n     = 31 + 2*sqrt(31*33) + 33\n     = 64 + 2*sqrt(1023)\n\nNow, I have A² = 45 + 2*sqrt(374) and B² = 64 + 2*sqrt(1023). To compare A and B, I can compare A² and B².\n\nSo, I need to determine whether 45 + 2*sqrt(374) is greater than or less than 64 + 2*sqrt(1023). Let me subtract 45 from both sides to simplify the comparison:\n\n2*sqrt(374) vs 64 + 2*sqrt(1023) - 45\nWhich simplifies to:\n2*sqrt(374) vs 19 + 2*sqrt(1023)\n\nHmm, that still leaves me with a square root on both sides. Maybe I can divide both sides by 2 to make it simpler:\n\nsqrt(374) vs 9.5 + sqrt(1023)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful because 9.5 is much smaller than sqrt(1023), which is about 32. So, sqrt(374) is approximately 19.33, and 9.5 + 32 is 41.5. So, 19.33 < 41.5, meaning sqrt(374) < 9.5 + sqrt(1023). Therefore, 2*sqrt(374) < 2*sqrt(1023) + 19.\n\nBut from earlier, we had:\n\n2*sqrt(374) vs 19 + 2*sqrt(1023)\n\nWhich is the same as 2*sqrt(374) vs 2*sqrt(1023) + 19, which is exactly what we just found. So, since 2*sqrt(374) is less than 2*sqrt(1023) + 19, that means A² < B².\n\nTherefore, since A squared is less than B squared, A must be less than B. So, sqrt(11) + sqrt(34) is less than sqrt(31) + sqrt(33).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when dealing with square roots, approximations can play a role.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values:\n\nsqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166\nsqrt(34) ≈ 5.8309\nSo, sqrt(11) + sqrt(34) ≈ 3.3166 + 5.8309 ≈ 9.1475\n\nsqrt(31) ≈ 5.5678\nsqrt(33) ≈ 5.7446\nSo, sqrt(31) + sqrt(33) ≈ 5.5678 + 5.7446 ≈ 11.3124\n\nSo, numerically, sqrt(11) + sqrt(34) ≈ 9.1475 and sqrt(31) + sqrt(33) ≈ 11.3124, so indeed sqrt(31) + sqrt(33) is larger.\n\nWait, but earlier when I squared them, I concluded A² < B², so A < B. So, both methods agree.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to compare these two sums without squaring.\n\nI remember that sometimes, when comparing two sums, you can compare the individual terms or use the triangle inequality. But in this case, since both are sums of square roots, I think squaring was the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, another strategy is to consider the difference between the two sums and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nLet’s compute B - A = (sqrt(31) + sqrt(33)) - (sqrt(11) + sqrt(34)).\n\nI can rearrange this as (sqrt(31) - sqrt(11)) + (sqrt(33) - sqrt(34)).\n\nNow, sqrt(31) - sqrt(11): Let me approximate that. sqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166, sqrt(31) ≈ 5.5678, so difference is about 2.2512.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(33) - sqrt(34): sqrt(34) ≈ 5.8309, sqrt(33) ≈ 5.7446, so difference is about -0.0963.\n\nSo, total difference is approximately 2.2512 - 0.0963 ≈ 2.1549, which is positive. So, B - A ≈ 2.1549, which is positive, meaning B is larger.\n\nThat's consistent with the numerical calculation as well. So, B is greater than A, meaning sqrt(31) + sqrt(33) is larger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another perspective. Maybe using the concept of convexity or concavity of the square root function? Since sqrt is concave, we can use Jensen's inequality. But in this case, since it's a sum of square roots, it might not directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function f(x) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compare the pairs (11,34) and (31,33). Maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, 11 and 34: 11 + 34 = 45, and 31 + 33 = 64. So, the sums of the numbers inside the square roots are different.\n\nIs there a way to compare sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) based on the sum x + y? Maybe if x + y is larger, then depending on the individual x and y, sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) could be larger or smaller, but it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. But I'm not sure if that would help here.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe I can square both and compare. Since we did that earlier and it gave a clear answer, perhaps that's the most straightforward method.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me also compute the squares more precisely.\n\nCompute A² = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(34))² = 11 + 34 + 2*sqrt(11*34) = 45 + 2*sqrt(374)\nCompute B² = (sqrt(31) + sqrt(33))² = 31 + 33 + 2*sqrt(31*33) = 64 + 2*sqrt(1023)\n\nNow, sqrt(374): Let me compute sqrt(374). Since 19² = 361 and 20²=400, so sqrt(374) is between 19 and 20. Let's compute 19.3² = 372.49, which is less than 374. 19.4²=376.36, which is more than 374. So, sqrt(374) ≈ 19.3 + (374 - 372.49)/(376.36 - 372.49) ≈ 19.3 + 1.51/3.87 ≈ 19.3 + 0.39 ≈ 1"

So, we're comparing:\n\nsqrt(18) + sqrt(45) versus sqrt(43) + sqrt(44).\n\nI guess I can compute both values numerically to see which one is bigger. That might be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to compare them without calculating the exact decimals. Let me think.\n\nIf I recall, sometimes when you have square roots, you can approximate them or find bounds to compare. For instance, if I can find two numbers a and b such that a < sqrt(18) + sqrt(45) < b and similarly for the other expression, then I can compare a and b to see which is larger. That might be a bit tedious, but it could work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the idea that sqrt(x) is a concave function. So, maybe I can use the concavity to compare the sums. Wait, I think there's something called the triangle inequality for concave functions, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should just go with numerical approximation.\n\nAlright, let's compute both expressions numerically. I can calculate sqrt(18), sqrt(45), sqrt(43), and sqrt(44) individually and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, sqrt(18). I know that sqrt(16) is 4, and sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(18) should be somewhere between 4 and 5. Let me try to approximate it. 18 is 2 more than 16, so maybe sqrt(18) is approximately 4.2426, since 4.2426 squared is 18. Let me confirm that: 4.2426 * 4.2426 is 18. Yeah, that's right.\n\nNext, sqrt(45). Similarly, sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(45) is between 6 and 7. Let me calculate 6.7 squared: 6.7 * 6.7 is 44.89, which is just below 45. So, sqrt(45) is approximately 6.7082. Let me check: 6.7082 * 6.7082. Hmm, 6 * 6 is 36, 6 * 0.7082 is about 4.2492, so 0.7082 squared is approx 0.5016. Then, cross terms: 2 * 6 * 0.7082 is about 8.4984. So, adding up: 36 + 8.4984 + 0.5016 is approximately 45. So, yeah, sqrt(45) is roughly 6.7082.\n\nNow, moving on to sqrt(43) and sqrt(44). Let's approximate sqrt(43). Since sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7, sqrt(43) is between 6 and 7. Let me try 6.5 squared: 6.5 * 6.5 is 42.25. That's just below 43. So, sqrt(43) is a bit more than 6.5. Let's compute 6.52 squared: 6.52 * 6.52. 6 * 6 is 36, 6 * 0.52 is 3.12, so 0.52 squared is 0.2704. Then, cross terms: 2 * 6 * 0.52 is about 6.24. So, total is 36 + 6.24 + 0.2704 is approximately 42.5104. That's still below 43. So, 6.52 gives us 42.5104. Let's try 6.53 squared: 6.53 * 6.53. 6 * 6 is 36, 6 * 0.53 is 3.18, so 0.53 squared is 0.2809. Cross terms: 2 * 6 * 0.53 is 6.36. So, adding up: 36 + 6.36 + 0.2809 is approximately 42.6409. Still below 43. Hmm, 6.54 squared: 6.54 * 6.54. 6 * 6 is 36, 6 * 0.54 is 3.24, so 0.54 squared is 0.2916. Cross terms: 2 * 6 * 0.54 is 6.48. So, adding up: 36 + 6.48 + 0.2916 is approximately 42.7716. Still below 43. 6.55 squared: 6.55 * 6.55. 6 * 6 is 36, 6 * 0.55 is 3.3, so 0.55 squared is 0.3025. Cross terms: 2 * 6 * 0.55 is 6.6. So, adding up: 36 + 6.6 + 0.3025 is approximately 42.9025. Getting closer. 6.56 squared: 6.56 * 6.56. 6 * 6 is 36, 6 * 0.56 is 3.36, so 0.56 squared is 0.3136. Cross terms: 2 * 6 * 0.56 is 6.72. So, total is 36 + 6.72 + 0.3136 which is approximately 43.0336. Ah, that's above 43. So, sqrt(43) is between 6.55 and 6.56.\n\nTo get a better approximation, let's do linear interpolation between 6.55 and 6.56. At 6.55, we have 42.9025, and at 6.56, we have 43.0336. The difference between 6.55 and 6.56 is 0.01, and the difference between 42.9025 and 43.0336 is 0.1311. Since our value is 43, which is 43 - 42.9025 = 0.0975 above 42.9025. So, the fraction is 0.0975 / 0.1311 ≈ 0.742. So, sqrt(43) ≈ 6.55 + 0.742 * 0.01 ≈ 6.55 + 0.00742 ≈ 6.55742. Let me check 6.55742 squared: approximately 6.55742 * 6.55742. Let me compute 6.55 * 6.55 first, which is 42.9025. Then 0.00742 squared is negligible. The cross term is 2 * 6.55 * 0.00742 ≈ 2 * 6.55 * 0.00742 ≈ 13.1 * 0.00742 ≈ 0.0971. So, total is approximately 42.9025 + 0.0971 ≈ 43. So, yeah, sqrt(43) ≈ 6.5574.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute sqrt(44). It's between 6.6 and 6.7 since sqrt(44) is just above sqrt(49) which is 7, but wait, sqrt(44) is actually between 6.6 and 6.7 because sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7. Let me actually compute 6.6 squared: 6.6 * 6.6 is 43.56, which is just below 44. So, sqrt(44) is a bit more than 6.6. Let's do the same approach.\n\nCompute 6.6 squared: 43.56. Then, 6.61 squared: 6.61 * 6.61. 6 * 6 is 36, 6 * 0.61 is 3.66, so "

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two sums of square roots: sqrt(4) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(42) + sqrt(44). Hmm, okay. I remember that sometimes when you have square roots, squaring them can help compare their sizes because if you square both expressions, the larger one will have a larger square. But before I jump into squaring, maybe I should try to see if there's another way, like estimating the values or thinking about how the square roots behave.\n\nLet me write down both expressions clearly:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(4) + sqrt(47)\nExpression B: sqrt(42) + sqrt(44)\n\nFirst off, sqrt(4) is straightforward—it's 2. So Expression A becomes 2 + sqrt(47). That's a good start because I know sqrt(47) is a bit more than sqrt(49), which is 7, so sqrt(47) is approximately 6.8 or something. So Expression A is roughly 2 + 6.8 = 8.8.\n\nNow, Expression B: sqrt(42) + sqrt(44). Hmm, sqrt(42) is a bit less than sqrt(49), which is 7, so maybe around 6.4 or so. And sqrt(44) is a bit more than sqrt(49), so maybe around 6.6 as well. Adding those together, 6.4 + 6.6 = 13.0. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no—sqrt(42) is less than sqrt(44), right? Because 42 is less than 44. So actually, sqrt(42) is around 6.48, and sqrt(44) is around 6.63. So adding those together: 6.48 + 6.63 = approximately 13.11.\n\nWait a second, so Expression B is around 13.11 and Expression A is around 8.8. So that would make sqrt(42) + sqrt(44) larger than sqrt(4) + sqrt(47). But that seems too straightforward—is there a mistake here?\n\nLet me double-check the approximations. For sqrt(47): 6.8 squared is 46.24, and 6.9 squared is 47.61. So sqrt(47) is between 6.8 and 6.9, closer to 6.86. Similarly, sqrt(42): 6.48 squared is 42; 6.48^2 = (6 + 0.48)^2 = 36 + 2*6*0.48 + 0.48^2 = 36 + 5.76 + 0.2304 = 42. So sqrt(42) is exactly 6.48. Wait, no, 6.48 squared is 42. So sqrt(42) is exactly 6.48? Wait, no, 6.48 squared is 42, right? Wait, 6^2 is 36, 0.48^2 is 0.2304, and 2*6*0.48 is 5.76, so 36 + 5.76 + 0.2304 is 42. So sqrt(42) is 6.48? Wait, no, that can't be because 6.48 is sqrt(42) only if 6.48 squared is 42, but 6.48 squared is 42, so sqrt(42) is 6.48. Wait, that's not right because 6.48 is 6 and 0.48, but 6.48 squared is 42. So sqrt(42) is 6.48? Wait, no, that seems like a wrong number because sqrt(42) is approximately 6.4807. So, actually, I think my earlier calculation was a bit off.\n\nWait, 6.48 squared is 42, so sqrt(42) is 6.48. But that's not accurate because 6.48 squared is 42, but sqrt(42) is 6.4807. So, actually, sqrt(42) is approximately 6.4807.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(44): Let's see, 6.6 squared is 43.56, and 6.61 squared is (6.6 + 0.01)^2 = 6.6^2 + 2*6.6*0.01 + 0.01^2 = 43.56 + 0.132 + 0.0001 = 43.6921. So sqrt(44) is between 6.6 and 6.61. Let me calculate 6.64 squared: 6.64^2 = (6.6 + 0.04)^2 = 6.6^2 + 2*6.6*0.04 + 0.04^2 = 43.56 + 0.528 + 0.0016 = 44.0896. So sqrt(44) is approximately 6.6332.\n\nSo, let's recalculate Expression B:\n\nsqrt(42) ≈ 6.4807\nsqrt(44) ≈ 6.6332\n\nAdding those together: 6.4807 + 6.6332 ≈ 13.1139.\n\nExpression A: sqrt(4) + sqrt(47) is 2 + sqrt(47). Let's calculate sqrt(47): 6.8^2 is 46.24, 6.9^2 is 47.61. So sqrt(47) is approximately 6.855. So Expression A is 2 + 6.855 ≈ 8.855.\n\nSo, comparing the two: Expression A is approximately 8.855, Expression B is approximately 13.1139. Therefore, Expression B is larger.\n\nBut wait, that seems really large. Let me think again. So sqrt(42) is approximately 6.48, sqrt(44) is approximately 6.63, so together they are roughly 13.11. On the other hand, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(47) is approximately 6.855, so adding them gives about 8.855. So definitely, Expression B is larger.\n\nBut, hold on, let me think about this in another way—maybe using the fact that for positive numbers a and b, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) is increasing with a and b. So, if I can compare sqrt(42) and sqrt(4), and sqrt(44) and sqrt(47), but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions and compare the results.\n\nLet me try that. So, let me compute (sqrt(4) + sqrt(47))^2 and (sqrt(42) + sqrt(44))^2.\n\nStarting with Expression A squared:\n\n(sqrt(4) + sqrt(47))^2 = (2)^2 + 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(47) + (sqrt(47))^2 = 4 + 2*2*sqrt(47) + 47 = 4 + 4*sqrt(47) + 47 = 51 + 4*sqrt(47).\n\nSimilarly, Expression B squared:\n\n(sqrt(42) + sqrt(44))^2 = (sqrt(42))^2 + 2*sqrt(42)*sqrt(44) + (sqrt(44))^2 = 42 + 2*sqrt(42*44) + 44 = 86 + 2*sqrt(1848).\n\nSo now, we have Expression A squared: 51 + 4*sqrt(47)\nExpression B squared: 86 + 2*sqrt(1848)\n\nWe can compute the approximate values of sqrt(47), sqrt(1848), and then plug them in.\n\nFirst, sqrt(47) is approximately 6.855 as before.\n\nSo, 4*sqrt(47) ≈ 4*6.855 ≈ 27.42.\n\nTherefore, Expression A squared ≈ 51 + 27.42 ≈ 78.42.\n\nNow, sqrt(1848). Let's see: 42^2 is 1764, 43^2 is 1849. So sqrt(1848) is just a little less than 43, maybe 42.98 or something. Let me compute 42.98^2:\n\n42.98^2 = (43 - "

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to compare sqrt(18) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(23) + sqrt(42) and figure out which one is larger. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nMaybe I can simplify each square root first to see if that makes it easier to compare. Let me try that. \n\nStarting with sqrt(18). I know that 18 can be broken down into 9 * 2, and since 9 is a perfect square, sqrt(18) should be sqrt(9*2) which is sqrt(9) * sqrt(2) = 3*sqrt(2). Cool, so sqrt(18) simplifies to 3*sqrt(2).\n\nNext, sqrt(50). Similarly, 50 can be factored into 25 * 2, and 25 is a perfect square. So sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2) = 5*sqrt(2). That simplifies nicely to 5*sqrt(2).\n\nSo now, sqrt(18) + sqrt(50) is 3*sqrt(2) + 5*sqrt(2). Let me add those together. 3 + 5 is 8, so that becomes 8*sqrt(2). \n\nAlright, moving on to the other expression: sqrt(23) + sqrt(42). Let me see if these can be simplified, or if I need to approximate them. \n\nStarting with sqrt(23). That doesn't seem like a perfect square, so I can leave it as sqrt(23). Similarly, sqrt(42) is also not a perfect square, so I can't simplify that either. \n\nSo, I have sqrt(23) + sqrt(42). Hmm, okay. Maybe I can approximate these values numerically to get a sense of their sizes. \n\nLet me recall that sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(23) is between 4 and 5. Let me estimate. 23 is 7 more than 16. The difference between 25 and 16 is 9. So, approximately, sqrt(23) is 4 + 7*(9/16) = 4 + 7*0.5625 = 4 + 3.9375 = 7.9375? Wait, that doesn't make sense because sqrt(25) is 5, so 23 is 2 less than 25, not 7 less. \n\nWait, my mistake. The difference between 25 and 16 is 9, so from 16 to 25 is 9. So, sqrt(23) is 16 + 7, so 7/9 of the way from 16 to 25? Hmm, let me think. Maybe I can use a better approximation. Alternatively, I remember that sqrt(23) is approximately 4.796. Let me verify that. \n\nYes, because 4.8 squared is 23.04, which is just a bit more than 23. So, sqrt(23) is approximately 4.796.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(42). Let's see. 36 is 6 squared, 49 is 7 squared. 42 is 6 and 6. So, sqrt(42) is between 6 and 7. Let's approximate it. 42 is 6 more than 36. So, similar to before, the difference between 36 and 49 is 13. So, 6/13 of the way from 6 to 7. \n\nWait, 42 is 6 more than 36, so 6/13 of 1 is 6/13, so 6 + 6/13 ≈ 6 + 0.4615 ≈ 6.4615. Hmm, but sqrt(42) is actually approximately 6.4807. So, my initial approximation was a bit low, but that's okay because we're just estimating.\n\nSo, sqrt(23) ≈ 4.796 and sqrt(42) ≈ 6.4807. \n\nAdding them together: 4.796 + 6.4807 ≈ 11.2767.\n\nEarlier, we had sqrt(18) + sqrt(50) equal to 8*sqrt(2). Let me compute that. sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so 8*1.4142 ≈ 11.3136.\n\nSo, adding sqrt(18) + sqrt(50): 8*sqrt(2) ≈ 11.3136, and sqrt(23) + sqrt(42) ≈ 11.2767. So, 11.3136 is larger than 11.2767. Therefore, sqrt(18) + sqrt(50) is larger than sqrt(23) + sqrt(42).\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a way to compare them without approximating, because I might be making an error there.\n\nAnother approach could be squaring both expressions to eliminate the square roots, but since both expressions are sums of square roots, squaring them will result in cross terms that might be tricky. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(18) + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(23) + sqrt(42). I need to compare A and B.\n\nSo, let's compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(18) + sqrt(50))^2 = (sqrt(18))^2 + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(50) + (sqrt(50))^2 = 18 + 2*sqrt(900) + 50 = 18 + 2*30 + 50 = 18 + 60 + 50 = 128.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, A^2 is 128.\n\nNow, let's compute B^2.\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(23) + sqrt(42))^2 = (sqrt(23))^2 + 2*sqrt(23)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))^2 = 23 + 2*sqrt(966) + 42 = 23 + 42 + 2*sqrt(966) = 65 + 2*sqrt(966).\n\nNow, sqrt(966). Let me compute that. 31^2 = 961, 32^2 = 1024. So, sqrt(966) is approximately 31.08. Therefore, 2*sqrt(966) ≈ 2*31.08 ≈ 62.16.\n\nTherefore, B^2 ≈ 65 + 62.16 ≈ 127.16.\n\nSo, A^2 = 128 and B^2 ≈ 127.16. Since 128 > 127.16, it follows that A > B. So, sqrt(18) + sqrt(50) is larger than sqrt(23) + sqrt(42).\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier approximation results. So, both methods give me the same conclusion.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me go through them again.\n\nFor A^2:\n\n18 + 50 = 68, and 2*sqrt(900) = 2*30 = 60. So, 68 + 60 = 128. That seems correct.\n\nFor B^2:\n\n23 + 42 = 65, and 2*sqrt(966) ≈ 2*31.08 ≈ 62.16. So, 65 + 62.16 ≈ 127.16. Correct.\n\nSo, since 128 > 127.16, A^2 > B^2, so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(18) + sqrt(50) is larger than sqrt(23) + sqrt(42).\n\nAlternatively, another method could be to compare the two expressions term by term or use some inequality principles.\n\nFor example, since sqrt(18) = 3*sqrt(2) and sqrt(50) = 5*sqrt(2), so their sum is 8*sqrt(2). Similarly, sqrt(23) + sqrt(42) is approximately 11.2767. 8*sqrt(2) is approximately 11.3136, so again, the first is larger.\n\nAlternatively, without approximating, we can note that sqrt(23) is approximately sqrt(25) - something, but that might not be as helpful.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to see which pair of numbers"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(5) + sqrt(26) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(22). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(5) + sqrt(26) is larger than sqrt(18) + sqrt(22), or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can square both expressions to make the comparison easier? I remember that squaring can help compare sums of square roots because it turns them into sums of integers and cross terms, which might be easier to handle.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(26) and B = sqrt(18) + sqrt(22). I need to compare A and B. If I square both A and B, I can compare A² and B² instead. That should give me a clearer idea.\n\nCalculating A²: (sqrt(5) + sqrt(26))². Using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So, A² = (sqrt(5))² + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(26) + (sqrt(26))². Simplifying each term: 5 + 2*sqrt(130) + 26. Adding those together, 5 + 26 is 31, so A² = 31 + 2*sqrt(130).\n\nSimilarly, calculating B²: (sqrt(18) + sqrt(22))². Again, using the same formula. B² = (sqrt(18))² + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(22) + (sqrt(22))². Simplifying each term: 18 + 2*sqrt(396) + 22. Adding 18 and 22 gives 40, so B² = 40 + 2*sqrt(396).\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B², which are 31 + 2*sqrt(130) and 40 + 2*sqrt(396). To make this comparison manageable, I can subtract 31 from both to get just the terms with the square roots: 2*sqrt(130) versus 9 + 2*sqrt(396). Hmm, wait, that might not be the best approach. Maybe I should consider subtracting 31 from both to make them similar?\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Instead of subtracting 31, I can subtract 31 from both A² and B² to compare the cross terms:\n\nA² - 31 = 2*sqrt(130)\n\nB² - 31 = 9 + 2*sqrt(396)\n\nSo now I can compare 2*sqrt(130) and 9 + 2*sqrt(396). Let's denote X = 2*sqrt(130) and Y = 9 + 2*sqrt(396). If I can compare X and Y, that would tell me whether A² is larger or smaller than B².\n\nLet me compute X and Y numerically. First, sqrt(130) is approximately 11.401754, so 2*sqrt(130) is about 22.803508.\n\nNext, sqrt(396) is approximately 19.899748, so 2*sqrt(396) is approximately 39.799496. Adding 9 to that gives Y ≈ 39.799496 + 9 = 48.799496.\n\nSo now, we have X ≈ 22.8035 and Y ≈ 48.7995. So clearly, Y is larger than X. Therefore, B² - 31 > A² - 31, which implies that B² > A². Therefore, since both A and B are positive numbers, that means B is larger than A.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because I want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nCalculating sqrt(130): 130 is between 121 (11²) and 144 (12²). 11.4² is 129.96, so sqrt(130) is approximately 11.401754, so 2*sqrt(130) is approximately 22.8035. That seems right.\n\nCalculating sqrt(396): 396 is between 361 (19²) and 400 (20²). 19.899748² is approximately 396, so 2*sqrt(396) is approximately 39.7995. Adding 9 gives us approximately 48.7995. So, yes, 48.7995 is larger than 22.8035. Therefore, B² is larger than A², so B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(18) + sqrt(22) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(26). So the larger number is sqrt(18) + sqrt(22). Therefore, we should write that in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) where a=18 and b=22. So the answer is sqrt(18) + sqrt(22).\n\nBut wait, let me just think if I made any wrong assumptions. I squared both expressions, compared the results, and since B² is larger, B is larger. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the differences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use another method. Maybe subtract the two expressions and see if the result is positive or negative.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(18) + sqrt(22) - sqrt(5) - sqrt(26). If this is positive, then B > A; if negative, then A > B.\n\nBut computing this directly might be tricky because it's a sum of square roots. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate each square root to a decimal and then compute the sum.\n\nLet's try that. Let me approximate each term:\n\nsqrt(5): approximately 2.23607\n\nsqrt(18): approximately 4.24264\n\nsqrt(22): approximately 4.69042\n\nsqrt(26): approximately 5.09902\n\nSo, sqrt(18) + sqrt(22) ≈ 4.24264 + 4.69042 ≈ 8.93306\n\nsqrt(5) + sqrt(26) ≈ 2.23607 + 5.09902 ≈ 7.33509\n\nComparing 8.93306 and 7.33509, clearly, 8.93306 is larger. So that confirms that sqrt(18) + sqrt(22) is larger.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result: B² is larger than A², and approximating the sums gives B > A.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(18) + sqrt(22), so I can write that in the requested form.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{18} + \\sqrt{22}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{26}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{18} + \\sqrt{22}\\), we can square both expressions to make the comparison easier.\n\nLet \\(A = \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{26}\\) and \\(B = \\sqrt{18} + \\sqrt{22}\\).\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(A^2\\):\n\\[\nA^2 = (\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{26})^2 = (\\sqrt{5})^2 + 2\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt{26} + (\\sqrt{26})^2 = 5 + 2\\sqrt{130} + 26 = 31 + 2\\sqrt{130}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\(B^2\\):\n\\[\nB^2 = (\\sqrt{18} + \\sqrt{22})^2 = (\\sqrt{18})^2 + 2\\sqrt{18}\\sqrt{22} + (\\sqrt{22})^2 = 18 + 2\\sqrt{396} + 22 = 40 + 2\\sqrt{396}\n\\]\n\nWe need to compare \\(A^2\\) and \\(B^2\\):\n\\[\nA^2 = 31 + 2\\sqrt{130}\n\\]\n\\[\nB^2 = 40 + 2\\sqrt{396}\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 31 from both:\n\\[\nA^2 - 31 = 2\\sqrt{130}\n\\]\n\\[\nB^2 - 31 = 9 + 2\\sqrt{396}\n\\]\n\nWe compare \\(2\\sqrt{130}\\) and \\(9 + 2\\sqrt{396}\\).

Both expressions have square roots, so maybe I can compare them by squaring both expressions. That often helps with these kinds of problems because squaring can simplify things, though I have to be careful since squaring can sometimes make larger numbers into smaller ones depending on the context. But let's try it.\n\nFirst, let me write down both expressions:\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(2) + sqrt(38)\nExpression 2: sqrt(15) + sqrt(36)\n\nI need to compare these two.

To compare A and B, I need to compare A² and B².\n\nSo, if I can determine whether A² is less than, equal to, or greater than B², that will tell me whether A is less than, equal to, or greater than B.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values of both A² and B².\n\nFirst, compute A²:\n\nA² = 40 + 2*sqrt(76)\nsqrt(76) is approximately 8.7178 (since 8.7178² ≈ 76)\nSo, 2*sqrt(76) ≈ 2*8.7178 ≈ 17.4356\nThus, A² ≈ 40 + 17.4356 ≈ 57.4356\n\nNow, compute B²:\n\nB² = 51 + 2*sqrt(540)\nsqrt(540) is approximately 23.2379 (since 23.2379² ≈ 540)\nSo, 2*sqrt(540) ≈ 2*23.2379 ≈ 46.4758\nThus, B² ≈ 51 + 46.4758 ≈ 97.4758\n\nSo, A² ≈ 57.4356 and B² ≈ 97.4758.\n\nTherefore, since 57.4356 < 97.4758, it means that A² < B². Therefore, A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(2) + sqrt(38) is less than sqrt(15) + sqrt(36).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error somewhere.\n\nSo, sqrt(76): 8^2=64, 9^2=81, so sqrt(76) is between 8 and 9. Let's compute 8.7178^2:\n\n8.7178 * 8.7178:\n\nFirst, 8 * 8 = 64\n\n8 * 0.7178 ≈ 5.7424\n\n0.7178 * 8 ≈ 5.7424\n\n0.7178^2 ≈ 0.515\n\nSo, adding these up:\n\n64 + 5.7424 + 5.7424 + 0.515 ≈ 64 + 11.4848 + 0.515 ≈ 76. (64 + 11.4848 = 75.4848 + 0.515 ≈ 76.0. Okay, so sqrt(76) ≈ 8.7178 is correct.\n\nThen 2*sqrt(76) ≈ 17.4356, so A² = 40 + 17.4356 ≈ 57.4356. That seems correct.\n\nNow, sqrt(540): Let's compute that.\n\n540 is 9*60, so sqrt(540) = sqrt(9*60) = 3*sqrt(60). sqrt(60) is approximately 7.746, so 3*7.746 ≈ 23.238. Therefore, sqrt(540) ≈ 23.238. So 2*sqrt(540) ≈ 46.476.\n\nThus, B² = 51 + 46.476 ≈ 97.476. So B² ≈ 97.476, which is indeed much larger than A² ≈ 57.4356.\n\nTherefore, A < B. So, sqrt(2) + sqrt(38) is less than sqrt(15) + sqrt(36). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(15) + sqrt(36).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to compare them without squaring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compare the two expressions by seeing if one is greater than the other without squaring.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(2) + sqrt(38) and B = sqrt(15) + sqrt(36).\n\nI can rearrange terms: B - A = sqrt(15) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(2) - sqrt(38)\n\nLet me compute this difference:\n\nsqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298, sqrt(38) is approximately 6.1644, and sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142.\n\nSo, B - A ≈ 3.87298 + 6 - 1.4142 - 6.1644\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n3.87298 + 6 = 9.87298\n\n1.4142 + 6.1644 = 7.5786\n\nSo, 9.87298 - 7.5786 ≈ 2.29438\n\nSo, B - A ≈ 2.29438, which is positive, so B > A.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(15) + sqrt(36).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compare sqrt(15) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(2) + sqrt(38) without squaring.\n\nLet me try to see if sqrt(15) + sqrt(36) is indeed larger.\n\nBut perhaps I can think about estimating each term.\n\nsqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298 as I calculated earlier.\n\nsqrt(36) is 6.\n\nSo, sqrt(15) + sqrt(36) ≈ 3.87298 + 6 ≈ 9.87298.\n\nsqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, sqrt(38) is approximately 6.1644, so sqrt(2) + sqrt(38) ≈ 1.4142 + 6.1644 ≈ 7.5786.\n\nSo, 9.87298 is greater than 7.5786, so yes, B is larger.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: perhaps adding the two terms in a different way.\n\nBut I think the squaring method is solid.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can pair the terms differently.\n\nFor example, sqrt(15) is sqrt(9 + 6) = sqrt(9 + 6), but that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(15) = sqrt(25"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(4) + sqrt(48) is larger than sqrt(23) + sqrt(35), or vice versa. Hmm, let me start by simplifying each of these square roots as much as possible because that might make the comparison easier.\n\nFirst, sqrt(4) is straightforward. Since 4 is a perfect square, sqrt(4) is just 2. So that part is easy. Now, sqrt(48). Hmm, 48 isn't a perfect square, but I know that 16 and 25 are perfect squares, and 16*3=48. So, sqrt(48) can be simplified as sqrt(16*3) which is sqrt(16)*sqrt(3) = 4*sqrt(3). So, sqrt(48) is 4 times the square root of 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, sqrt(4) + sqrt(48) is 2 + 4*sqrt(3). Let me write that down: 2 + 4√3.\n\nNow, let me look at the other pair: sqrt(23) + sqrt(35). Both 23 and 35 aren't perfect squares, so I can't simplify those radicals any further. Hmm, so I need to compare 2 + 4√3 and sqrt(23) + sqrt(35). Maybe I can calculate approximate values for each to see which one is larger.\n\nStarting with 2 + 4√3: I know that sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So, 4*1.732 is about 6.928. Adding 2 to that gives me roughly 8.928. So, 2 + 4√3 is approximately 8.928.\n\nNow, sqrt(23): I know that 4² is 16 and 5² is 25, so sqrt(23) is somewhere between 4 and 5. Let me calculate a better approximation. 4.8² is 23.04, so sqrt(23) is just a tiny bit less than 4.8, maybe approximately 4.796.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(35): 5² is 25 and 6² is 36, so sqrt(35) is just a bit less than 6. Let's see, 5.9² is 34.81, so sqrt(35) is about 5.916. \n\nSo, sqrt(23) + sqrt(35) is approximately 4.796 + 5.916. Let me add those: 4.796 + 5.916. Let's break it down: 4 + 5 is 9, 0.796 + 0.916 is about 1.712. So, total is 9 + 1.712 = 10.712.\n\nWait a second, that seems way bigger than 8.928. But wait, sqrt(23) is about 4.8, sqrt(35) is about 5.9, so 4.8 + 5.9 is 10.7. That seems correct. So, sqrt(23) + sqrt(35) is approximately 10.7, and sqrt(4) + sqrt(48) is approximately 8.928. So, clearly, sqrt(23) + sqrt(35) is larger.\n\nBut let me double-check because sometimes approximations can mislead. Maybe I should use a more accurate method for sqrt(23) and sqrt(35). Alternatively, I could square both expressions and compare them. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(48) = 2 + 4√3, and B = sqrt(23) + sqrt(35). I want to compare A and B. Let's square both A and B and see which one is larger.\n\nSo, A² = (2 + 4√3)². Let's compute that: 2² + 2*(2)*(4√3) + (4√3)² = 4 + 16√3 + 16*3 = 4 + 16√3 + 48 = 52 + 16√3.\n\nSimilarly, B² = (sqrt(23) + sqrt(35))² = 23 + 2*sqrt(23)*sqrt(35) + 35 = 23 + 35 + 2*sqrt(805). So, that's 58 + 2*sqrt(805).\n\nNow, I can compare A² and B². So, A² = 52 + 16√3 and B² = 58 + 2√805.\n\nSo, to compare 52 + 16√3 and 58 + 2√805.\n\nLet me compute the difference: B² - A² = (58 + 2√805) - (52 + 16√3) = 6 + 2√805 - 16√3.\n\nSo, if I can show that 6 + 2√805 - 16√3 is positive, then B² > A², which would mean B > A.\n\nAlternatively, if I can compute approximate values for the terms:\n\nFirst, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 16√3 ≈ 16*1.732 ≈ 27.712.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(805): Let me compute that. 28² is 784, 29² is 841, so sqrt(805) is between 28 and 29. Let's see, 28.4² is 28² + 2*28*0.4 + 0.4² = 784 + 22.4 + 0.16 = 806.56. That's just a bit over 805, so sqrt(805) is approximately 28.4 - a tiny bit.\n\nLet's compute 28.4²: 28.4*28.4: 28*28=784, 28*0.4=11.2, 0.4*28=11.2, 0.4*0.4=0.16. So, adding up: 784 + 11.2 + 11.2 + 0.16 = 806.56. So, that's correct. So, sqrt(805) is 28.4 - approximately (806.56 - 805)/ (2*28.4), which is the linear approximation. So, the difference is about 1.56 over 56.8, which is approximately 0.0274. So, sqrt(805) is approximately 28.4 - 0.0274 ≈ 28.3726.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(805) ≈ 2*28.3726 ≈ 56.7452.\n\nSimilarly, 16√3 ≈ 27.712.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(805) - 16√3 ≈ 56.7452 - 27.712 ≈ 29.0332.\n\nThen, adding the 6: 6 + 29.0332 ≈ 35.0332.\n\nSo, that's a positive number, which means B² - A² ≈ 35.0332, which is positive. Therefore, B² > A², so B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(23) + sqrt(35) is larger than sqrt(4) + sqrt(48). So, the answer should be sqrt(23) + sqrt(35). But just to make sure, let me go back to my approximate calculations.\n\nI had earlier approximated A ≈ 8.928 and B ≈ 10.712. So, that's consistent. So, B is larger.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to compare these without squaring. Maybe by estimating how much each sqrt term contributes.\n\nLet me think about the individual terms.\n\nsqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(48) is about 6.928, so together, that's about 8.928.\n\nsqrt(23) is about 4.796, sqrt(35) is about 5.916, so together, that's about 10.712.\n\nSo, as before, 10.712 is larger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see how much each of sqrt(23) and sqrt(35) contribute beyond sqrt(4) and sqrt(48).\n\nSo, sqrt(23"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(6) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) or vice versa. Hmm, okay, let me jot down the two expressions to make it clearer:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(6) + sqrt(41)\nExpression B: sqrt(18) + sqrt(28)\n\nI remember that to compare two sums of square roots, one approach is to square both expressions and then compare the results. Since squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, if I can compare A^2 and B^2, I should be able to determine which original expression is larger.\n\nLet me calculate A^2 first. \n\nA^2 = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(41))^2\n= (sqrt(6))^2 + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))^2\n= 6 + 2*sqrt(246) + 41\n= 47 + 2*sqrt(246)\n\nOkay, so A^2 is 47 plus twice the square root of 246. Now, let me compute B^2.\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(18) + sqrt(28))^2\n= (sqrt(18))^2 + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))^2\n= 18 + 2*sqrt(504) + 28\n= 46 + 2*sqrt(504)\n\nSo, B^2 is 46 plus twice the square root of 504. Now, let me see which one is bigger. Comparing A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 = 47 + 2*sqrt(246)\nB^2 = 46 + 2*sqrt(504)\n\nSubtracting B^2 from A^2:\n\n(47 + 2*sqrt(246)) - (46 + 2*sqrt(504)) = 1 + 2*(sqrt(246) - sqrt(504))\n\nHmm, let me compute sqrt(246) and sqrt(504) approximately to see what's going on.\n\nFirst, sqrt(246). I know that 15^2 is 225 and 16^2 is 256, so sqrt(246) is somewhere between 15 and 16. Let's approximate:\n\n246 - 225 = 21, so it's 21/31 above 225. So, approximately, sqrt(246) ≈ 15 + 21/31 ≈ 15.677\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(504). Since 22^2 is 484 and 23^2 is 529, so sqrt(504) is between 22 and 23. Let's compute 504 - 484 = 20, so it's 20/47 above 484. Thus, sqrt(504) ≈ 22 + 20/47 ≈ 22.425\n\nSo, sqrt(246) - sqrt(504) ≈ 15.677 - 22.425 ≈ -6.748\n\nTherefore, 1 + 2*(-6.748) ≈ 1 - 13.496 ≈ -12.496\n\nSo, that means A^2 - B^2 ≈ -12.496, which is negative. Therefore, A^2 < B^2, which implies that A < B.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems contradictory. If A^2 is less than B^2, then A is less than B. So, sqrt(6) + sqrt(41) is less than sqrt(18) + sqrt(28). So, the larger number is sqrt(18) + sqrt(28).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit counterintuitive.\n\nLet me recast the problem. Maybe instead of squaring both expressions, I can find a different approach or verify my approximations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compare sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) and sqrt(6) + sqrt(41) by seeing if one can be expressed in terms of the other or find another relationship.\n\nWait, sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2), sqrt(28) is 2*sqrt(7), sqrt(6) is sqrt(6), and sqrt(41) is sqrt(41). Maybe approximate all the square roots with more precision.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(6):\n\nsqrt(6) is approximately 2.449\n\nsqrt(41): Let me compute 6^2 = 36, 7^2 = 49, so sqrt(41) is between 6 and 7. Let's compute 6.4^2 = 40.96, which is very close to 41. So, sqrt(41) is approximately 6.403.\n\nSo, Expression A: 2.449 + 6.403 ≈ 8.852\n\nExpression B: sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2) ≈ 3*1.414 ≈ 4.242\n\nsqrt(28): 28 is 4*7, so sqrt(28)=2*sqrt(7). sqrt(7) is approximately 2.645, so sqrt(28)=2*2.645≈5.291\n\nTherefore, Expression B: 4.242 + 5.291 ≈ 9.533\n\nSo, that's much more precise. So, Expression A is approximately 8.852 and Expression B is approximately 9.533, so clearly, Expression B is larger. So, sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) is larger.\n\nWait a second, that contradicts my earlier algebraic approach that suggested A^2 < B^2, which would imply A < B. But when I computed the approximate values, it's clear that B is larger. So, perhaps my algebraic approach was wrong.\n\nWait, let me go back to the algebraic method.\n\nCompute A^2: 47 + 2*sqrt(246)\n\nCompute B^2: 46 + 2*sqrt(504)\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 = (47 - 46) + (2*sqrt(246) - 2*sqrt(504)) = 1 + 2*(sqrt(246) - sqrt(504))\n\nEarlier, I found sqrt(246) ≈15.677, sqrt(504)≈22.425.\n\nSo, sqrt(246) - sqrt(504) ≈ -6.748\n\nMultiply by 2: -13.496\n\nThen, 1 + (-13.496) ≈ -12.496\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 ≈ -12.496, which is negative, so A^2 < B^2, so A < B.\n\nBut when I approximated numerically, A ≈8.852, B≈9.533, so A < B. Thus, it's consistent.\n\nWait, so why did I initially think maybe Expression B is larger? Maybe I was confused because 8.852 vs 9.533, but in reality, 9.533 is larger than 8.852.\n\nTherefore, Expression B is larger than Expression A.\n\nBut let me see, maybe there's another way to compare them without computing the squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept that for positive numbers, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) is larger when a and b are larger.\n\nBut in this case, sqrt(6) + sqrt(41) vs sqrt(18) + sqrt(28). Let me see:\n\nsqrt(6) ≈2.45, sqrt(41)≈6.40, so adding gives≈8.85\n\nsqrt(18)≈4.24, sqrt(28)≈5.29, adding gives≈9.53\n\nSo, the second expression is clearly larger.\n\nWait, maybe try to think of it as the sum of two square roots. So, if I can find the difference between the two sums.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nSum1 = sqrt(6) + sqrt(41)\n\nSum2 = sqrt(18) + sqrt(28)\n\nCompute Sum2 - Sum1:\n\n= [sqrt(18) + sqrt(28)] - [sqrt(6) + sqrt(41)]\n\n= sqrt(18) - sqrt(6) + sqrt(28) - sqrt(41)\n\nNow, compute each difference.\n\nsqrt(18) - sqrt(6) = sqrt(6*3) - sqrt(6)"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(2) + sqrt(32) and sqrt(22) + sqrt(25). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to compare sqrt(2) + sqrt(32) and sqrt(22) + sqrt(25). And then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger number in the form of sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should simplify some of these square roots to see if that helps. Starting with sqrt(32). I know that 32 is 16 times 2, right? So sqrt(32) is sqrt(16*2), which is sqrt(16) times sqrt(2). That simplifies to 4*sqrt(2). So sqrt(32) is 4*sqrt(2). Got that.\n\nSo now, the first expression sqrt(2) + sqrt(32) becomes sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(2). Let me write that down: sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(2). Hmm, okay, can I combine these terms? Yes, because they are like terms. So 1*sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(2) is (1+4)*sqrt(2) which is 5*sqrt(2). So sqrt(2) + sqrt(32) simplifies to 5*sqrt(2). Nice, that's simpler.\n\nNow, let's look at the second expression: sqrt(22) + sqrt(25). I know that sqrt(25) is straightforward—it's 5. So that part is easy. So now, the second expression is sqrt(22) + 5. So I have to compare 5*sqrt(2) with sqrt(22) + 5.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to figure out which is larger between 5*sqrt(2) and sqrt(22) + 5. Maybe I can subtract one from the other to see if the result is positive or negative. Let's try that.\n\nLet me denote A = 5*sqrt(2) and B = sqrt(22) + 5. I want to see if A > B or B > A. So, let's compute A - B.\n\nA - B = 5*sqrt(2) - sqrt(22) - 5. Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can approximate the values of sqrt(2), sqrt(22), and 5 to see which one is larger.\n\nLet's recall some approximate values:\n\n- sqrt(1) = 1\n- sqrt(4) = 2\n- sqrt(9) = 3\n- sqrt(16) = 4\n- sqrt(25) = 5\n- sqrt(36) = 6\n\nSo, sqrt(2) is between 1 and 2. I remember that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142. Let me check: 1.4142 squared is approximately 2. So that's good.\n\nThen, 5*sqrt(2) would be 5 * 1.4142, which is 7.071. So, A is approximately 7.071.\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(22). Hmm, 22 is between 16 and 25, so sqrt(22) is between 4 and 5. Let's approximate it a bit more accurately. 4.6 squared is 21.16, and 4.7 squared is 22.09. So, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.690.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(22) + 5 is approximately 4.690 + 5 = 9.690.\n\nSo, A is approximately 7.071 and B is approximately 9.690. Clearly, B is larger. So, sqrt(22) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(32).\n\nBut wait, the question also asks to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, since we established that sqrt(22) + sqrt(25) is the larger one, we can just write that as sqrt(22) + sqrt(25). So, the answer is sqrt(22) + sqrt(25).\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, sqrt(32) is indeed 4*sqrt(2), since 4*4 is 16 and 16*2 is 32. So, sqrt(32) = 4*sqrt(2). Then, sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(2) is 5*sqrt(2). That's correct.\n\nThen, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.690, which is correct because 4.69^2 is about 21.9361, which is close to 22. So, sqrt(22) ≈ 4.690. Adding 5 gives approximately 9.690.\n\nOn the other hand, 5*sqrt(2) is approximately 7.071, which is less than 9.690. Therefore, sqrt(22) + 5 is indeed larger.\n\nAlternatively, just to be thorough, maybe I can square both expressions and compare them. Squaring might help because it can eliminate the square roots and make it easier to compare.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(2) + sqrt(32) and B = sqrt(22) + sqrt(25). We already simplified A to 5*sqrt(2). So, let's compute A squared and B squared.\n\nCompute A squared: (sqrt(2) + sqrt(32))^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(32) + (sqrt(32))^2.\n\nCompute that: 2 + 2*sqrt(64) + 32. Since sqrt(64) is 8, that becomes 2 + 2*8 + 32 = 2 + 16 + 32 = 50.\n\nSo, A squared is 50. Now, compute B squared: (sqrt(22) + sqrt(25))^2 = (sqrt(22))^2 + 2*sqrt(22)*sqrt(25) + (sqrt(25))^2.\n\nCompute that: 22 + 2*sqrt(550) + 25. So, 22 + 25 is 47, and then 2*sqrt(550). So, B squared is 47 + 2*sqrt(550).\n\nNow, sqrt(550) is a number we can approximate, but let's see if 47 + 2*sqrt(550) is greater than 50 or not. Let me compute 2*sqrt(550). sqrt(550) is approx 23.452, so 2*23.452 is approximately 46.904. Therefore, B squared is approximately 47 + 46.904 = 93.904.\n\nSo, B squared is approximately 93.904 and A squared is 50. Therefore, since 93.904 > 50, that means B is larger than A.\n\nThis confirms my earlier conclusion that sqrt(22) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(32).\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't approximate, I could have compared 5*sqrt(2) and sqrt(22) + 5 without squaring. Let's try that.\n\nI can write both expressions with the same number of terms. So, 5*sqrt(2) is  sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) + sqrt(2). So, 5*sqrt(2) is the sum of five sqrt(2)s.\n\nAnd sqrt(22) is approximately 4.690, so sqrt(22) + 5 is roughly 9.690.\n\nBut without approximating, perhaps I can see if 5*sqrt(2) is less than sqrt(22) + 5 by considering the difference.\n\nLet me denote D = (sqrt(22) + 5) - (5*sqrt(2)).\n\nIf D is positive, then sqrt(22) + 5 is larger, and vice versa.\n\nCompute D: sqrt(22) + 5 - 5*sqrt(2) = sqrt(22) - 5*sqrt(2) + 5.\n\nHmm, let's see if we can approximate this.\n\nWe know that sqrt(22) ≈ 4.690 and sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142. So, 5*sqrt(2) ≈ 7.071.\n\nThen, sqrt(22) - 5*sqrt(2) ≈ 4.690 - 7.071 ≈ -2.381.\n\nThen, adding 5: -2.381 + 5 ≈ 2.619.\n\nWhich is positive. So D ≈ 2"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(16) + sqrt(46) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(19). The question is asking me which one is larger and to write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(16) is a straightforward number because 16 is a perfect square. So sqrt(16) is 4. That means the first expression simplifies to 4 + sqrt(46). Now, sqrt(46) is a little trickier because 46 isn't a perfect square. Maybe I can approximate it? Let me recall that 6^2 is 36 and 7^2 is 49, so sqrt(46) is somewhere between 6 and 7. Let me see, 6.7^2 is 44.89, which is too low. 6.8^2 is 46.24. Oh, okay, so sqrt(46) is approximately 6.782. So, adding that to 4 gives roughly 10.782.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(18) + sqrt(19). Let's break these down. I know sqrt(18) is the same as sqrt(9*2), which is 3*sqrt(2). Similarly, sqrt(19) is just sqrt(19). Again, sqrt(19) isn't a perfect square, so I might need to approximate it. Let me think about the squares around 19. 4^2 is 16, 5^2 is 25. So sqrt(19) is between 4 and 5. Let's see, 4.3^2 is 18.49, which is close to 19. So sqrt(19) is approximately 4.358. So sqrt(18) is approximately 4.242, and adding that to sqrt(19)'s approximation of 4.358 gives roughly 8.600.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems low. Let me double-check. sqrt(18) is about 4.242, and sqrt(19) is about 4.358, so adding those together: 4.242 + 4.358 is indeed 8.600. So, the second expression is approximately 8.600, whereas the first one is approximately 10.782. So, clearly, sqrt(16) + sqrt(46) is larger.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should be more precise with the approximations to make sure. Let me try to calculate sqrt(46) more accurately. Let's see, 6.7^2 is 44.89, as I thought earlier. 6.78^2 is 6.78*6.78. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 6*6 = 36. Then, 6*0.78 = 4.68. Then, 0.78*6 = 4.68. And 0.78*0.78 is 0.6084. Adding those up: 36 + 4.68 + 4.68 + 0.6084. Let's do step by step: 36 + 4.68 is 40.68; 40.68 + 4.68 is 45.36; 45.36 + 0.6084 is 45.9684. So, 6.78^2 is 45.9684, which is very close to 46. So, sqrt(46) is approximately 6.782. So, adding that to 4 gives 10.782.\n\nNow, for sqrt(19), let's try 4.35^2. 4.35*4.35: 4*4 is 16, 4*0.35 is 1.4, 0.35*4 is 1.4, and 0.35*0.35 is 0.1225. Adding those up: 16 + 1.4 + 1.4 + 0.1225 = 16 + 2.8 + 0.1225 = 18.9225. So, 4.35^2 is 18.9225, which is less than 19. Let's try 4.36^2. 4.36*4.36: 4*4 is 16, 4*0.36 is 1.44, 0.36*4 is 1.44, and 0.36*0.36 is 0.1296. Adding those: 16 + 1.44 + 1.44 + 0.1296 = 16 + 2.88 + 0.1296 = 18.9996. So, 4.36^2 is approximately 18.9996, which is just shy of 19. Therefore, sqrt(19) is approximately 4.358.\n\nAdding that to sqrt(18), which is 3*sqrt(2). Let's approximate sqrt(2) as 1.414. So, 3*1.414 is 4.242. Adding that to 4.358 gives 8.600.\n\nWait, but hold on. Maybe instead of approximating each square root separately, I should consider squaring both expressions to compare them more precisely. That might be a better approach because squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, so if one squared expression is larger, then the original expression is also larger.\n\nSo, let me denote A = sqrt(16) + sqrt(46) and B = sqrt(18) + sqrt(19). Let's compute A^2 and B^2 and compare them.\n\nStarting with A^2:\nA^2 = (sqrt(16) + sqrt(46))^2\n= (sqrt(16))^2 + 2*sqrt(16)*sqrt(46) + (sqrt(46))^2\n= 16 + 2*sqrt(16*46) + 46\n= 16 + 46 + 2*sqrt(736)\n= 62 + 2*sqrt(736)\n\nNow, sqrt(736) is a number we can approximate. Let's see, 27^2 is 729, which is just below 736. 27^2 = 729, so 27.1^2 is 729 + 2*27*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 729 + 5.4 + 0.01 = 734.41. Hmm, 27.1^2 = 734.41, so 27.1^2 is close to 736. Let's try 27.15^2: 27 + 0.15. (27 + 0.15)^2 = 27^2 + 2*27*0.15 + 0.15^2 = 729 + 8.1 + 0.0225 = 737.1225. That's a bit over 736. So, sqrt(736) is between 27.1 and 27.15.\n\nLet's compute 27.1^2 = 734.41, 27.15^2 = 737.1225. So, 736 is 736 - 734.41 = 1.59 above 27.1^2, and 737.1225 - 736 = 1.1225 below 27.15^2. So, the difference between 27.1 and 27.15 is 0.05, and the difference between 734.41 and 737.1225 is 2.7125. So, 736 is 1.59 above 27.1^2, so it's (1.59 / 2.7125) * 0.05 above 27.1.\n\nCalculating that: 1.59 / 2.7125 ≈ 0.585. So, 0.585 * 0.05 ≈ 0.029. Therefore, sqrt(736) ≈ 27.1 + 0."

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) is larger than sqrt(18) + sqrt(25), and if it is, write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't behave linearly. That is, the square root of a sum isn't the sum of the square roots. So, I can't just say sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) is obviously larger than sqrt(18) + sqrt(25) because sqrt(18) is a larger number than sqrt(11). Let me write down the numbers:\n\nsqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166\nsqrt(18) ≈ 4.2426\nsqrt(25) = 5\nsqrt(30) ≈ 5.4772\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\nsqrt(11) + sqrt(30) ≈ 3.3166 + 5.4772 ≈ 8.7938\nsqrt(18) + sqrt(25) ≈ 4.2426 + 5 ≈ 9.2426\n\nWait, so according to these approximations, sqrt(18) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(30). Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake because sometimes intuition can be wrong when dealing with square roots. Maybe I should check my calculations to be sure.\n\nLet me verify the square roots more accurately:\n\nsqrt(11): 3^2 = 9, 4^2=16, so it's between 3 and 4. Let's calculate 3.3166^2:\n\n3.3166^2 = (3 + 0.3166)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.3166 + 0.3166^2 = 9 + 1.8996 + 0.0999 ≈ 10.9995, which is almost 11. So, sqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166 is correct.\n\nsqrt(30): 5^2=25, 6^2=36. Let's compute 5.4772^2:\n\n5.4772^2 = (5 + 0.4772)^2 = 25 + 2*5*0.4772 + 0.4772^2 = 25 + 4.772 + 0.2276 ≈ 25 + 4.772 is 29.772, plus 0.2276 is approximately 29.9996, which is almost 30. So sqrt(30) ≈ 5.4772 is correct.\n\nsqrt(18): 4^2=16, 5^2=25. Let's compute 4.2426^2:\n\n4.2426^2 = (4 + 0.2426)^2 = 16 + 2*4*0.2426 + 0.2426^2 = 16 + 1.9408 + 0.0589 ≈ 16 + 1.9408 is 17.9408, plus 0.0589 is approximately 17.9997, which is almost 18. So sqrt(18) ≈ 4.2426 is correct.\n\nsqrt(25) is just 5.\n\nSo, my initial approximations were correct. Then, adding them up:\n\nsqrt(11) + sqrt(30) ≈ 3.3166 + 5.4772 ≈ 8.7938\nsqrt(18) + sqrt(25) ≈ 4.2426 + 5 ≈ 9.2426\n\nSo according to this, sqrt(18) + sqrt(25) is larger. But wait, maybe this is just due to the approximations? Maybe I should check the exact values.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to compare sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(25) without approximating? Maybe by squaring both expressions to compare?\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote A = sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) and B = sqrt(18) + sqrt(25). I need to compare A and B.\n\nTo compare A and B, I can square both A and B and see which is larger.\n\nSo, A^2 = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(30))^2 = (sqrt(11))^2 + 2*sqrt(11)*sqrt(30) + (sqrt(30))^2 = 11 + 2*sqrt(330) + 30 = 41 + 2*sqrt(330)\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(18) + sqrt(25))^2 = (sqrt(18))^2 + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(25) + (sqrt(25))^2 = 18 + 2*sqrt(450) + 25 = 43 + 2*sqrt(450)\n\nSo now, A^2 = 41 + 2*sqrt(330)\nB^2 = 43 + 2*sqrt(450)\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(330) and sqrt(450):\n\nsqrt(330) ≈ 18.166\nsqrt(450) ≈ 21.213\n\nSo, sqrt(330) ≈ 18.166, so 2*sqrt(330) ≈ 36.332\nsqrt(450) ≈ 21.213, so 2*sqrt(450) ≈ 42.426\n\nNow, let's compute A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 = 41 + 36.332 ≈ 77.332\nB^2 = 43 + 42.426 ≈ 85.426\n\nSo, B^2 ≈ 85.426 and A^2 ≈ 77.332, so B^2 > A^2, which means B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(18) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(30).\n\nBut wait, that contradicts my initial approximation where A was approximately 8.79 and B was approximately 9.24. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, I think my initial approximation was correct because sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) is about 3.3166 + 5.4772 ≈ 8.7938, and sqrt(18) + sqrt(25) is about 4.2426 + 5 ≈ 9.2426, so indeed B is larger.\n\nBut when I squared them, I got A^2 ≈ 77.332 and B^2 ≈ 85.426, so B is larger. So, both methods agree.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(18) + sqrt(25). So, in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), that would be sqrt(18) + sqrt(25). But maybe the question expects a different form? Or perhaps we can write it as sqrt(9*2) + sqrt(25) which is sqrt(9) + sqrt(2) times sqrt(2), but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, but sqrt(18) can be written as sqrt(9*2) which is 3*sqrt(2), and sqrt(25) is just 5. So, alternatively, sqrt(18) + sqrt(25) can be written as 3*sqrt(2) + 5, but the question says to write it as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, maybe they just want 18 and 25 under the square roots? But 18 and 25 are not perfect squares, so that might not be ideal. Alternatively, we might have to write 18 and 25, but as 9*2 and 25.\n\nBut in any case, the problem says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\" So, if I can express it as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), with a and b integers, that's the form. So, since sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2) but that's not in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Alternatively, 18 and 25 under the square roots."

Hmm, let me write that down:\n\nCompare sqrt(11) + sqrt(27) and sqrt(12) + sqrt(16).\n\nAlright, I remember that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help because the square function is increasing for non-negative numbers. So maybe I can square both expressions and see which one is bigger. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me denote:\n\nA = sqrt(11) + sqrt(27)\n\nB = sqrt(12) + sqrt(16)\n\nI need to determine if A > B or B > A.\n\nTo compare A and B, I'll square both sides:\n\nA² = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(27))²\n\nB² = (sqrt(12) + sqrt(16))²\n\nLet me calculate A² first.\n\nA² = (sqrt(11))² + 2*sqrt(11)*sqrt(27) + (sqrt(27))²\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(sqrt(11))² = 11\n\n(sqrt(27))² = 27\n\nAnd the middle term is 2*sqrt(11)*sqrt(27). Let me compute that:\n\nsqrt(11)*sqrt(27) = sqrt(11*27) = sqrt(297)\n\nSo, the middle term is 2*sqrt(297). Let me note that.\n\nSo, A² = 11 + 2*sqrt(297) + 27\n\nCombine like terms: 11 + 27 = 38\n\nSo, A² = 38 + 2*sqrt(297)\n\nNow, let's compute B²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(12) + sqrt(16))²\n\nAgain, expand it:\n\n= (sqrt(12))² + 2*sqrt(12)*sqrt(16) + (sqrt(16))²\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(sqrt(12))² = 12\n\n(sqrt(16))² = 16\n\nThe middle term is 2*sqrt(12)*sqrt(16) = 2*sqrt(12*16) = 2*sqrt(192)\n\nSo, B² = 12 + 2*sqrt(192) + 16\n\nCombine like terms: 12 + 16 = 28\n\nHence, B² = 28 + 2*sqrt(192)\n\nNow, I have A² = 38 + 2*sqrt(297) and B² = 28 + 2*sqrt(192). I need to compare these two values.\n\nTo make it easier, let me subtract the smaller from the larger to see if the difference is positive.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can compare sqrt(297) and sqrt(192) first. Since sqrt(297) is definitely larger than sqrt(192) because 297 > 192. But I have to account for the coefficients of sqrt(297) and sqrt(192) multiplied by 2 in both expressions.\n\nSo, let me write:\n\nA² - B² = (38 + 2*sqrt(297)) - (28 + 2*sqrt(192))\n\nSimplify that:\n\n= (38 - 28) + (2*sqrt(297) - 2*sqrt(192))\n\n= 10 + 2*(sqrt(297) - sqrt(192))\n\nNow, I need to determine if this difference is positive or negative. Since sqrt(297) is significantly larger than sqrt(192), the term 2*(sqrt(297) - sqrt(192)) is positive, but I also have the +10. So, is 10 + something positive enough to make the whole thing positive?\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate the difference in sqrt(297) and sqrt(192) to see how much it contributes.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(297) and sqrt(192) separately.\n\nFirst, sqrt(192):\n\n192 = 64*3, so sqrt(192) = sqrt(64*3) = 8*sqrt(3) ≈ 8*1.732 ≈ 13.856\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(297):\n\n297 = 9*33, but 33 is 3*11, so sqrt(297) = sqrt(9*33) = 3*sqrt(33). Hmm, sqrt(33) is approximately 5.7446, so 3*5.7446 ≈ 17.2338.\n\nSo, sqrt(297) ≈ 17.2338, sqrt(192) ≈ 13.856\n\nSo, sqrt(297) - sqrt(192) ≈ 17.2338 - 13.856 ≈ 3.3778\n\nThen, 2*(sqrt(297) - sqrt(192)) ≈ 2*3.3778 ≈ 6.7556\n\nSo, A² - B² ≈ 10 + 6.7556 ≈ 16.7556, which is clearly positive. Hence, A² > B², which implies A > B.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I squared both sides, I assumed that both A and B are positive, which they are, since sqrt(11), sqrt(27), sqrt(12), sqrt(16) are all positive. So, squaring is a valid operation here.\n\nTherefore, A² > B² implies A > B.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me calculate the numerical values of A and B to cross-verify.\n\nCompute A: sqrt(11) + sqrt(27)\n\nsqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166\n\nsqrt(27) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 5.1962\n\nSo, A ≈ 3.3166 + 5.1962 ≈ 8.5128\n\nCompute B: sqrt(12) + sqrt(16)\n\nsqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3) ≈ 3.4641\n\nsqrt(16) = 4\n\nSo, B ≈ 3.4641 + 4 ≈ 7.4641\n\nComparing 8.5128 and 7.4641, indeed A is larger.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute A² and B² numerically as well.\n\nA² ≈ (8.5128)² ≈ 72.46\n\nB² ≈ (7.4641)² ≈ 55.69\n\nSo, 72.46 > 55.69, which again confirms that A² > B², so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(11) + sqrt(27) is larger than sqrt(12) + sqrt(16). So, the larger number is sqrt(11) + sqrt(27), which can be written as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) with a=11 and b=27.\n\nBut just to ensure that I didn't make any errors in my calculations, let me recap:\n\n1. I squared both A and B to compare them.\n2. Calculated A² and B², then subtracted to see if A² > B².\n3. Found that sqrt(297) is significantly larger than sqrt(192), so the difference is positive.\n4. Computed numerical approximations to verify, which also showed A > B.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that sqrt(11) + sqrt(27) is larger than sqrt(12) + sqrt(16).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{27}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{27}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{12} + \\sqrt{16}\\), we can square both expressions and compare the results.\n\nLet \\(A = \\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{27}\\) and \\(B = \\sqrt{12} + \\sqrt{16}\\).\n\nFirst, we square both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\n\\[\nA^2 = (\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{27})^2 = (\\sqrt{11})^2 + 2\\sqrt{11}\\sqrt{27} + (\\sqrt{27})^2 = 11 + 2\\sqrt{297} + 27\n\\]\n\\[\nA^2 = 38 + 2\\sqrt{29"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(4) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(21) + sqrt(44). I need to figure out which one is larger and express the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute each square root individually to see what they are. Sometimes breaking it down helps me understand better.\n\nStarting with sqrt(4): that's straightforward. The square root of 4 is 2 because 2 times 2 is 4. So, sqrt(4) = 2.\n\nNext, sqrt(50). Hmm, 50 isn't a perfect square, so I need to simplify it. Let me think about how to break down 50. 50 can be factored into 25 and 2. Since 25 is a perfect square, I can take that out of the square root. So, sqrt(50) is the same as sqrt(25*2), which is sqrt(25)*sqrt(2). That simplifies to 5*sqrt(2). I know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so 5*1.414 is about 7.07. So, sqrt(50) is approximately 7.07.\n\nNow, let me compute sqrt(21). Again, 21 isn't a perfect square, but I can break it down. 21 factors into 3 and 7, both primes. So, sqrt(21) is just sqrt(3*7). Since neither 3 nor 7 are perfect squares, this doesn't simplify further, so I'll just keep it as sqrt(21). I know that sqrt(21) is approximately 4.583 because 4.583 squared is roughly 21.\n\nThen, sqrt(44). Similarly, 44 can be broken down. 44 is 4*11, and 4 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(44) is sqrt(4*11) which is sqrt(4)*sqrt(11) = 2*sqrt(11). Now, sqrt(11) is approximately 3.316, so 2*3.316 is about 6.632. So, sqrt(44) is approximately 6.632.\n\nAlright, now let me summarize what each individual term is:\n\n- sqrt(4) = 2\n- sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07\n- sqrt(21) ≈ 4.583\n- sqrt(44) ≈ 6.632\n\nSo, let's compute the original expressions.\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(4) + sqrt(50) = 2 + 7.07 ≈ 9.07.\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(21) + sqrt(44) ≈ 4.583 + 6.632 ≈ 11.215.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. 4.583 + 6.632 is indeed about 11.215. But 2 + 7.07 is 9.07, which is way less than 11.215. That makes me think I must have done something wrong, or maybe the question was meant to have sqrt(21) and sqrt(44) as separate terms, but I misread it.\n\nWait, no, wait. The problem says sqrt(21) + sqrt(44). So, that's about 4.583 + 6.632 ≈ 11.215. And sqrt(4) + sqrt(50) is 2 + 7.07 ≈ 9.07. So, 11.215 is larger than 9.07, so sqrt(21) + sqrt(44) is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me check my approximations again because sometimes approximations can be misleading.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(50) more precisely. Since 50 is 25*2, sqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2). I know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.41421356, so 5*1.41421356 is 7.0710678. So, sqrt(50) ≈ 7.0710678.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(21): 21 is between 16 and 25, so sqrt(21) is between 4 and 5. Let me compute it more accurately. 4.5 squared is 20.25, and 4.58 squared is let's see: 4.58*4.58. Let me compute 4*4=16, 4*0.58=2.32, 0.58*4=2.32, 0.58*0.58≈0.3364. So, adding up: 16 + 2.32 + 2.32 + 0.3364 ≈ 20.9764. So, 4.58 squared is 20.9764, which is less than 21. So, sqrt(21) is a bit more than 4.58. Let's try 4.583 squared: 4.583*4.583. Let's compute 4*4=16, 4*0.583=2.332, 0.583*4=2.332, 0.583*0.583≈0.340. So, adding up: 16 + 2.332 + 2.332 + 0.340 ≈ 21. So, 4.583 squared is approximately 21, so sqrt(21) ≈ 4.583.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(44): 44 is between 36 and 49, so sqrt(44) is between 6 and 7. Let me compute 6.632 squared. 6.6 squared is 43.56, and 6.632 squared: 6*6=36, 6*0.632=3.792, 0.632*6=3.792, 0.632*0.632≈0.400. So, 36 + 3.792 + 3.792 + 0.400 ≈ 44. So, 6.632 squared is approximately 44, so sqrt(44)≈6.632.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(21) ≈4.583 and sqrt(44)≈6.632, adding up to ≈11.215.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(4)=2 and sqrt(50)=≈7.071, adding up to ≈9.071.\n\nSo, 11.215 is more than 9.071, so the second expression is larger.\n\nWait, but the problem says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, according to my calculation, sqrt(21) + sqrt(44) is the larger one, so I just need to write sqrt(21) + sqrt(44) as the answer.\n\nBut hold on, I feel like that might not be correct. Maybe there's a trick here, or maybe I need to compare them without approximating each term, which might make the comparison more accurate.\n\nLet me think about another approach. Maybe I can square both expressions and compare the squares. That is, let me compute (sqrt(4) + sqrt(50))² and (sqrt(21) + sqrt(44))², and then see which one is larger.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nFirst expression squared: (sqrt(4) + sqrt(50))² = (sqrt(4))² + 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(50) + (sqrt(50))² = 4 + 2*sqrt(200) + 50.\n\nSimplify sqrt(200): sqrt(200) = sqrt(100*2) = 10*sqrt(2) ≈14.142.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(200) ≈28.284.\n\nSo, the first squared expression is 4 + 28.284 + 50 ≈82.284.\n\nSecond expression squared: (sqrt(21) + sqrt(44))² = (sqrt(21))² + 2*sqrt(21)*sqrt(44) + (sqrt(44))² =21 + 2*sqrt(924) +44.\n\nSimplify sqrt(924): let's"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(48) and sqrt(35) + sqrt(44). And I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they aren't linear. That is, the square root of a sum isn't the same as the sum of the square roots. So, I need a strategy to compare these two expressions without actually calculating their exact decimal values. Maybe by squaring both expressions? That might make it easier to compare them.\n\nLet me denote the first expression as A: sqrt(7) + sqrt(48), and the second one as B: sqrt(35) + sqrt(44). So, I need to figure out whether A is greater than B or vice versa.\n\nTo compare A and B, I can square both A and B. Let's do that.\n\nStarting with squaring A:\n\nA² = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(48))²\n    = (sqrt(7))² + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(48) + (sqrt(48))²\n    = 7 + 2*sqrt(7*48) + 48\n    = 7 + 48 + 2*sqrt(336)\n    = 55 + 2*sqrt(336)\n\nNow, let's compute B²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(35) + sqrt(44))²\n    = (sqrt(35))² + 2*sqrt(35)*sqrt(44) + (sqrt(44))²\n    = 35 + 2*sqrt(35*44) + 44\n    = 35 + 44 + 2*sqrt(1540)\n    = 79 + 2*sqrt(1540)\n\nSo, now I have A² = 55 + 2*sqrt(336) and B² = 79 + 2*sqrt(1540).\n\nTo compare A and B, I can compare A² and B². If A² > B², then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's compute the difference between B² and A²:\n\nB² - A² = (79 + 2*sqrt(1540)) - (55 + 2*sqrt(336))\n         = 79 - 55 + 2*sqrt(1540) - 2*sqrt(336)\n         = 24 + 2*(sqrt(1540) - sqrt(336))\n\nSo, if I can determine whether 24 + 2*(sqrt(1540) - sqrt(336)) is positive or negative, that will tell me whether B² is greater than A² or not.\n\nAlternatively, since both terms have a factor of 2, I can factor that out:\n\nB² - A² = 2*(12 + sqrt(1540) - sqrt(336))\n\nSo, now, I just need to check whether 12 + sqrt(1540) - sqrt(336) is positive or negative.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(1540) and sqrt(336) approximately.\n\nStarting with sqrt(1540). Hmm, 39² = 1521, which is pretty close to 1540. So, sqrt(1540) is a bit more than 39. Let me compute 39.2²:\n\n39.2² = (39 + 0.2)² = 39² + 2*39*0.2 + 0.2² = 1521 + 15.6 + 0.04 = 1536.64\n\nHmm, that's still less than 1540. Let's try 39.3²:\n\n39.3² = (39 + 0.3)² = 39² + 2*39*0.3 + 0.3² = 1521 + 23.4 + 0.09 = 1544.49\n\nOkay, 39.3² is 1544.49, which is more than 1540. So, sqrt(1540) is between 39.2 and 39.3.\n\nTo approximate it more precisely, let's see how much above 39.2 it is.\n\nWe have 39.2² = 1536.64\n\n39.2 + x)² = 1540, where x is a small number.\n\nExpanding (39.2 + x)² = 39.2² + 2*39.2*x + x² = 1536.64 + 78.4x + x² = 1540.\n\nAssuming x² is negligible, we can approximate:\n\n1536.64 + 78.4x ≈ 1540\n\nSo, 78.4x ≈ 1540 - 1536.64 = 3.36\n\nThus, x ≈ 3.36 / 78.4 ≈ 0.042857\n\nSo, sqrt(1540) ≈ 39.2 + 0.042857 ≈ 39.242857\n\nSo, approximately 39.2429.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute sqrt(336).\n\nWe know that 18² = 324, 19² = 361. So, sqrt(336) is between 18 and 19.\n\nCompute 18.3²:\n\n18.3² = (18 + 0.3)² = 18² + 2*18*0.3 + 0.3² = 324 + 10.8 + 0.09 = 334.89\n\nThat's less than 336.\n\nCompute 18.4²:\n\n18.4² = (18 + 0.4)² = 18² + 2*18*0.4 + 0.4² = 324 + 14.4 + 0.16 = 338.56\n\nSo, sqrt(336) is between 18.3 and 18.4.\n\nLet's approximate it more accurately.\n\nWe have 18.3² = 334.89\n\n336 - 334.89 = 1.11\n\nThe difference between 18.3 and 18.4 is 1.11.\n\nSo, 1.11 / (18.4² - 18.3²) = 1.11 / (338.56 - 334.89) = 1.11 / 3.67 ≈ 0.3\n\nSo, sqrt(336) ≈ 18.3 + 0.3 ≈ 18.6\n\nWait, but let me verify that.\n\nWait, actually, the linear approximation might not be that accurate here because the function is quadratic. Let me instead use the linear approximation.\n\nLet’s denote f(x) = x², and we know that f(18.3) = 334.89, f(18.4) = 338.56.\n\nWe want to find x such that f(x) = 336.\n\nSo, x ≈ 18.3 + (336 - 334.89)/(338.56 - 334.89) = 18.3 + (1.11)/(3.67) ≈ 18.3 + 0.3 ≈ 18.6.\n\nSo, sqrt(336) ≈ 18.6. Let me check 18.6²:\n\n18.6² = (18 + 0.6)² = 18² + 2*18*0.6 + 0.6² = 324 + 21.6 + 0.36 = 345.96\n\nWait, that's way higher than 336. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe my linear approximation was wrong because the function is convex, so the linear approximation overshoots.\n\nWait, actually, 18.6² is 345.96, which is more than 336. So, that means that sqrt(336) is less than 18.6. Wait, no: 336 is less than 345.96, so sqrt(336) is less than 18.6. Wait,"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which is larger between sqrt(5) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(6) + sqrt(32). Hmm, I remember that sometimes when you have square roots, you can compare them by squaring both expressions, which might make it easier to handle. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let me denote A as sqrt(5) + sqrt(47) and B as sqrt(6) + sqrt(32). So, I need to compare A and B.\n\nTo compare them, I'll square both A and B and see which one is larger. If A^2 > B^2, then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nLet's compute A^2 first.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(5) + sqrt(47))^2\n      = (sqrt(5))^2 + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(47) + (sqrt(47))^2\n      = 5 + 2*sqrt(5*47) + 47\n      = 5 + 47 + 2*sqrt(235)\n      = 52 + 2*sqrt(235)\n\nOkay, that was straightforward. Now, let's compute B^2.\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(32))^2\n      = (sqrt(6))^2 + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(32) + (sqrt(32))^2\n      = 6 + 2*sqrt(6*32) + 32\n      = 6 + 32 + 2*sqrt(192)\n      = 38 + 2*sqrt(192)\n\nSo, now we have A^2 = 52 + 2*sqrt(235) and B^2 = 38 + 2*sqrt(192). To compare A^2 and B^2, let's compute the difference between them.\n\nCompute A^2 - B^2:\n\n= (52 + 2*sqrt(235)) - (38 + 2*sqrt(192))\n= 52 - 38 + 2*sqrt(235) - 2*sqrt(192)\n= 14 + 2*(sqrt(235) - sqrt(192))\n\nHmm, okay. So, the difference is 14 plus twice the difference of the square roots. I need to figure out whether this is positive or negative.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(235) and sqrt(192) approximately to see the difference.\n\nFirst, sqrt(235): 15^2 = 225, 16^2=256, so sqrt(235) is between 15 and 16. Let's estimate:\n\n15^2 = 225, 15.5^2 = 240.25, which is more than 235. So sqrt(235) is about 15.32.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(192): 13^2=169, 14^2=196, so sqrt(192) is between 13 and 14. Let's compute 13.8^2: 13.8*13.8=190.44, which is less than 192. 13.9^2=193.21, which is more than 192. So sqrt(192) is approximately 13.85.\n\nSo, sqrt(235) ≈15.32 and sqrt(192)≈13.85.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(235) - sqrt(192) ≈15.32 -13.85≈1.47.\n\nThen, 2*(sqrt(235)-sqrt(192))≈2*1.47≈2.94.\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2≈14 +2.94≈16.94.\n\nSince 16.94 is positive, that means A^2 > B^2, so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(5) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(32).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations, because sometimes approximations can lead to errors. Maybe I should compute the exact difference without approximating.\n\nWait, another approach: instead of approximating, perhaps I can compare sqrt(235) and sqrt(192) more precisely.\n\nWait, sqrt(235) = sqrt(192 + 43) = sqrt(192 + 43). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute (sqrt(235) - sqrt(192))^2 to see if it's positive.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(235) - sqrt(192))^2.\n\n= (sqrt(235))^2 + (sqrt(192))^2 - 2*sqrt(235)*sqrt(192)\n=235 + 192 - 2*sqrt(235*192)\n=427 - 2*sqrt(45,600)\n\nWait, 235*192: Let me compute that.\n\n235*192: Let's compute 200*192=38,400; 35*192=6,720; so total is 38,400 +6,720=45,120.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(45,120)=2*sqrt(45,120). Let me compute sqrt(45,120).\n\nWait, sqrt(45,120). Let's see, 212^2=44,944, 213^2=45,369. So sqrt(45,120) is between 212 and 213.\n\nCompute 212^2=44,944; 45,120 -44,944=176. So 212 +176/(2*212)=212 +176/424≈212 +0.415≈212.415.\n\nSo, sqrt(45,120)≈212.415\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(45,120)≈2*212.415≈424.83\n\nSo, 427 -424.83≈2.17.\n\nSo, (sqrt(235)-sqrt(192))^2≈2.17, which is positive, meaning sqrt(235) - sqrt(192)≈sqrt(2.17)≈1.473, which matches my earlier approximation.\n\nThus, sqrt(235) - sqrt(192)≈1.473.\n\nTherefore, 2*(sqrt(235)-sqrt(192))≈2.946.\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2≈14 +2.946≈16.946>0, so A^2 > B^2, so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(5) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(32).\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Maybe I can rationalize or compare the two expressions without squaring.\n\nLet me consider A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(47) and B = sqrt(6) + sqrt(32).\n\nI can write sqrt(32) as 4*sqrt(2), so B = sqrt(6) +4*sqrt(2).\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(5) + sqrt(47) is as it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare each term.\n\nWait, but sqrt(5) is about 2.236, sqrt(47) is about 6.855, so A≈2.236 +6.855≈9.091.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(6)≈2.449, sqrt(32)=4*sqrt(2)≈5.656, so B≈2.449 +5.656≈8.105.\n\nSo, A≈9.091 and B≈8.105, so A > B.\n\nThat's a rough approximation, but it gives the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute A - B and show it's positive.\n\nCompute A - B = sqrt(5) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(6) - sqrt(32).\n\nI can compute this difference numerically.\n\nCompute sqrt(5)=~2.236, sqrt(47)=~6.855, sqrt(6)=~2.449, sqrt(32)=~5.656.\n\nSo, A≈2.236 +6.855≈9.091, B≈2"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(1) + sqrt(35) is larger than sqrt(28) + sqrt(34) or vice versa. Hmm, okay. Let me write down the two expressions clearly:\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(1) + sqrt(35)\nSecond expression: sqrt(28) + sqrt(34)\n\nI think a good approach here is to compute the numerical values of each expression and then compare them. That should give me a clear answer. Let me start by calculating each square root.\n\nStarting with sqrt(1). That's straightforward. The square root of 1 is 1. So, the first expression simplifies to 1 + sqrt(35). I know that sqrt(35) is an irrational number, but I can approximate it. Let me recall that sqrt(25) is 5, and sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(35) must be somewhere between 5 and 6. Let me get a more precise value.\n\nTo approximate sqrt(35), I can use linear interpolation between 5 and 6. Since 35 is 35 - 25 = 10 away from 25, and the total difference between 25 and 36 is 11. So, 10/11 of the way from 5 to 6 should give me a better approximation. Let me compute that:\n\nThe difference between 5 and 6 is 1, so 10/11 of that is 10/11. Therefore, adding that to 5 gives me 5 + 10/11, which is approximately 5.909. So, sqrt(35) ≈ 5.909. Therefore, the first expression is approximately 1 + 5.909 = 6.909.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(28) + sqrt(34). Let's compute each of these square roots.\n\nStarting with sqrt(28). Since 25 is 5² and 36 is 6², sqrt(28) is between 5 and 6. Let's see, 28 is 3 less than 31 (which is 5.5², because 5.5*5.5=30.25). Hmm, wait, 5.5² is actually 30.25, so 28 is 28 - 25 = 3 less, so maybe a bit less than 5.5. Let me try to approximate it.\n\nI know that 5.29² is approximately 27.9841, which is close to 28. So, 5.29² ≈ 27.9841, which is just a hair less than 28. So, maybe sqrt(28) is approximately 5.29 + a little bit more. Let me see, 5.3² is 28.09, which is just a bit more than 28. So, sqrt(28) is between 5.29 and 5.3. To get a more precise value, let's use linear approximation between 5.29² and 5.3².\n\nThe exact value is sqrt(28). Let me compute 5.29²: 5.29*5.29. Let me compute that:\n\n5*5 = 25\n5*0.29 = 1.45\n0.29*5 = 1.45\n0.29*0.29 = 0.0841\nSo, adding them up: 25 + 1.45 + 1.45 + 0.0841 = 25 + 2.9 + 0.0841 = 27.9841. So, as I had before.\n\nNow, 5.3² is (5 + 0.3)² = 5² + 2*5*0.3 + 0.3² = 25 + 3 + 0.09 = 28.09.\n\nSo, 5.29² = 27.9841 and 5.3² = 28.09. So, sqrt(28) is between 5.29 and 5.3. Let's find the exact value.\n\nThe difference between 28 and 27.9841 is 0.0159, and the total difference between 28.09 and 27.9841 is 28.09 - 27.9841 = 0.1059.\n\nSo, sqrt(28) = 5.29 + (0.0159 / 0.1059)*(0.3 - 5.29). Wait, actually, it's linear approximation. The approximate value is 5.29 + (28 - 27.9841)/(28.09 - 27.9841)*(5.3 - 5.29). So, that would be 5.29 + (0.0159)/(0.1059)*0.01. Let me compute that:\n\n0.0159 / 0.1059 ≈ 0.1507.\n\nSo, 0.1507 * 0.01 = 0.001507.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(28) ≈ 5.29 + 0.001507 ≈ 5.2915.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915.\n\nNow, moving on to sqrt(34). Similarly, 34 is between 25 and 36, so sqrt(34) is between 5 and 6. Let's compute it.\n\nAgain, 5.8² is 33.64, and 5.9² is 34.81. So, sqrt(34) is between 5.8 and 5.9.\n\nLet me compute 5.8² = 33.64. So, 34 - 33.64 = 0.36.\n\nTotal difference between 5.9² and 5.8² is 34.81 - 33.64 = 1.17.\n\nSo, sqrt(34) = 5.8 + (0.36 / 1.17)*(5.9 - 5.8). Let's compute that:\n\n0.36 / 1.17 ≈ 0.3077.\n\nSo, 0.3077 * 0.1 ≈ 0.03077.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(34) ≈ 5.8 + 0.03077 ≈ 5.83077.\n\nSo, sqrt(34) ≈ 5.8308.\n\nTherefore, the second expression is sqrt(28) + sqrt(34) ≈ 5.2915 + 5.8308 ≈ 11.1223.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the first expression is approximately 6.909, and the second is approximately 11.1223. Comparing these two, clearly 11.1223 is larger than 6.909.\n\nWait, hold on. Just to make sure, I think I approximated sqrt(35) as 5.909, but actually, sqrt(35) is approximately 5.916079783, right? Let me check that.\n\nYes, sqrt(35) is approximately 5.91608. So, 1 + 5.91608 is 6.91608.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(28) is approximately 5.2915, and sqrt(34) is approximately 5.83098. So, adding them gives 5.2915 + 5.83098 ≈ 11.12248.\n\nTherefore, comparing 6.91608 and 11.12248, clearly 11.12248 is larger.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, I wonder if there's a more precise method to compare these without approximating each square root.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions and compare the squares. Since if a < b, then a² < b², provided that both a and b are positive, which they are here.\n\nSo, let me denote A = sqrt(1) + sqrt(35) = 1 + sqrt(35)\nand B = sqrt(28) + sqrt(34)\n\nThen, to compare A and B, I can compare A² and B².\n\nCompute A² = (1 + sqrt(35))² = 1² + 2*1*sqrt(35) + (sqrt(35))² = 1 + 2*sqrt"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to compare two sums of square roots: sqrt(9) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(14) + sqrt(35). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, interesting. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't play along nicely with addition. So, I can't just add the numbers inside the square roots and compare the results directly. Instead, I might need to find some way to approximate or compare these sums without calculating the exact values.\n\nLet me write down both expressions clearly:\n\n1. sqrt(9) + sqrt(47)\n2. sqrt(14) + sqrt(35)\n\nI can compute each of these individually, but since the numbers aren't too large, maybe I can get approximate values to see which one is bigger.\n\nStarting with the first expression: sqrt(9) + sqrt(47). I know that sqrt(9) is exactly 3 because 3*3=9. So, the first term is 3. Now, sqrt(47) is a bit trickier. I know that sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(47) must be a little bit more than 6. Let me estimate sqrt(47). How much is it?\n\nWell, 6^2 = 36, 7^2 = 49. 47 is 11 more than 36 and 2 less than 49. So, it's 11/13 of the way from 36 to 49? Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Maybe I can use linear approximation or just remember some squares.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that 6.8^2 is 46.24 because 6.8*6.8 is 46.24, right? Let me check: 6*6=36, 6*0.8=4.8, 0.8*6=4.8, and 0.8*0.8=0.64. So, 36 + 4.8 + 4.8 + 0.64 = 46.24. So, 6.8^2=46.24. And 6.9^2=47.61 because 6.9*6.9 is 47.61. So, 47 is between 6.8^2 and 6.9^2.\n\nSo, sqrt(47) is approximately 6.85, say. Let me see, 6.85^2 is 46.9225. That's pretty close to 47. So, sqrt(47) ≈ 6.85.\n\nTherefore, the first expression is 3 + 6.85 ≈ 9.85.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(14) + sqrt(35). Let's compute each term separately.\n\nFirst, sqrt(14). I know that sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(14) is somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me try to approximate it. 3.7^2 is 13.69, and 3.8^2 is 14.44. Since 14 is between 13.69 and 14.44, sqrt(14) is between 3.7 and 3.8.\n\nLet me compute 3.7^2 = 13.69.\n\n14 - 13.69 = 0.31. The difference between 14 and 13.69 is 0.31. The total interval from 3.7 to 3.8 is 0.12 in the square root and 14.44 -13.69=0.75 in the square value.\n\nSo, approximately, the sqrt(14) is 3.7 + (0.31 / 0.75)*0.12.\n\nCompute 0.31 / 0.75 ≈ 0.4133. Then, 0.4133 * 0.12 ≈ 0.0496.\n\nSo, sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7 + 0.0496 ≈ 3.7496, which is approximately 3.75.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(35). sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(35) is between 5 and 6. Let me compute 5.9^2: 5.9*5.9 is 34.81. That's a bit less than 35. Then, 5.92^2=35.0464. So, 5.92^2=35.0464, which is just above 35. So, sqrt(35) is approximately 5.916.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do this more accurately. Let's see, 5.9^2=34.81, as above. So, 35 - 34.81=0.19. So, the sqrt(35) is 5.9 + (0.19)/(2*5.9) using linear approximation. Wait, derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2sqrt(x)). So, delta x = 0.19, so delta sqrt(x) ≈ 0.19/(2*5.9)=0.19/11.8≈0.0161. So, sqrt(35)≈5.9 + 0.0161≈5.9161.\n\nSo, sqrt(35)≈5.916.\n\nSo, putting it all together: sqrt(14)≈3.75 and sqrt(35)≈5.916. Therefore, the second expression is approximately 3.75 + 5.916≈9.666.\n\nWait, so sqrt(9) + sqrt(47)≈9.85, and sqrt(14) + sqrt(35)≈9.666. Therefore, sqrt(9) + sqrt(47) is larger.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute the differences more precisely.\n\nCompute sqrt(47) more accurately. Since 6.85^2=46.9225, which is 0.0775 less than 47. So, sqrt(47)=6.85 + (0.0775)/(2*6.85)=6.85 + 0.0775/13.7≈6.85 + 0.00566≈6.85566.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(14): as above, linear approx gives 3.7 + (0.31)/(2*3.7)=3.7 + 0.31/7.4≈3.7 + 0.04189≈3.74189.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(14)≈3.74189 and sqrt(35)≈5.916.\n\nSo, sqrt(14) + sqrt(35)≈3.74189 + 5.916≈9.65789.\n\nAnd sqrt(9) + sqrt(47)≈3 + 6.85566≈9.85566.\n\nSo, 9.85566 > 9.65789, so sqrt(9) + sqrt(47) is indeed larger.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's a smarter way than approximating, because sometimes you can compare without exact decimal values.\n\nPerhaps, I can square both expressions and compare the squares. Since both expressions are sums of square roots, squaring them might make it easier to compare without dealing with the square roots.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = sqrt(9) + sqrt(47)\n\nB = sqrt(14) + sqrt(35)\n\nSo, compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(9) + sqrt(47))^2 = 9 + 2*sqrt(9*47) + 47 = 9 + 47 + 2*sqrt(423) = 56 + 2*sqrt(423)\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(35))^2 = 14 + 2*sqrt(14*35) + 35 = 14 + 35 + 2*sqrt(490) = 49 + 2*sqrt(490)\n\nSo, now, I can compute A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 = 56 + 2*sqrt(423)\n\nB^2 = "

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(14) + sqrt(44) and sqrt(29) + sqrt(33). Hmm, okay, I need to figure out which one is larger. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I can calculate the approximate values of each square root to see which sum is bigger. But wait, do I remember the squares of these numbers? Let me recall:\n\n- sqrt(14) is between 3 and 4 because 3²=9 and 4²=16. So, sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417.\n\n- sqrt(44) is between 6 and 7 because 6²=36 and 7²=49. So, sqrt(44) is approximately 6.6332.\n\nAdding these together: 3.7417 + 6.6332 = approximately 10.3749.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the other pair:\n\n- sqrt(29) is between 5 and 6 because 5²=25 and 6²=36. So, sqrt(29) is approximately 5.3852.\n\n- sqrt(33) is between 5 and 6 as well because 5²=25 and 6²=36. So, sqrt(33) is approximately 5.7446.\n\nAdding these together: 5.3852 + 5.7446 = approximately 11.1298.\n\nWait, that seems like sqrt(29) + sqrt(33) is about 11.1298, which is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(44) which is approximately 10.3749. So, based on these approximations, sqrt(29) + sqrt(33) is larger. But hold on, maybe my approximations are not precise enough? Or is there a better way to compare them without approximating?\n\nLet me think. Maybe I can square both expressions to see which one is larger because squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers. So, if I let A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(44) and B = sqrt(29) + sqrt(33), then perhaps I can compare A² and B².\n\nCalculating A²:\n\nA² = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(44))² = 14 + 44 + 2*sqrt(14*44) = 58 + 2*sqrt(616).\n\nSimilarly, calculating B²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(29) + sqrt(33))² = 29 + 33 + 2*sqrt(29*33) = 62 + 2*sqrt(957).\n\nSo, now, I need to compare 58 + 2*sqrt(616) and 62 + 2*sqrt(957). Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe I can subtract 58 from both sides to simplify:\n\nA² - 58 = 2*sqrt(616)\n\nB² - 58 = 2*sqrt(957)\n\nSo, now, if I can compare 2*sqrt(616) and 2*sqrt(957), I can find which one is larger. Since 2 is a common factor, the comparison is equivalent to comparing sqrt(616) and sqrt(957).\n\nBut sqrt(957) is definitely larger than sqrt(616) because 957 > 616. So, that would mean that B² - 58 is larger than A² - 58, which in turn means that B² > A². Since both A and B are positive, this implies that B > A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 2*sqrt(957) is much larger than 2*sqrt(616). So, that would mean that B² is much larger than A², hence B is larger than A. So, that seems consistent with my initial approximate calculation.\n\nHowever, I want to be absolutely sure. Let me see if I can compute sqrt(616) and sqrt(957) approximately.\n\nsqrt(616): Let's see, 24²=576, 25²=625. So sqrt(616) is between 24 and 25. Let me compute 24.8²: 24.8*24.8. 24*24=576, 24*0.8=19.2, 0.8*24=19.2, and 0.8*0.8=0.64. So, adding up: 576 + 19.2 + 19.2 + 0.64 = 576 + 38.4 + 0.64 = 615.04. Hmm, that's very close to 616. So, 24.8²=615.04, which is just 0.96 less than 616. So, sqrt(616) is approximately 24.8 + (0.96)/(2*24.8) using linear approximation.\n\nWhich is 24.8 + 0.96/49.6 ≈ 24.8 + 0.01938 ≈ 24.8194.\n\nSo, sqrt(616) ≈ 24.8194.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(957): Let's see, 30²=900, 31²=961. So, sqrt(957) is just a bit less than 31. Let me calculate 30.9²: 30 + 0.9. So, (30 + 0.9)² = 30² + 2*30*0.9 + 0.9² = 900 + 54 + 0.81 = 954.81. That's 954.81, which is less than 957.\n\nSo, 30.9²=954.81, and 31²=961. So, sqrt(957) is between 30.9 and 31. Let me compute 30.9²=954.81, 30.95²: Let's compute 30.95².\n\n30.95²: (30 + 0.95)² = 30² + 2*30*0.95 + 0.95² = 900 + 57 + 0.9025 = 957.9025.\n\nWait, that's way more than 957. So, 30.95²=957.9025, which is more than 957. So, sqrt(957) is slightly less than 30.95.\n\nTo find a better approximation, let's do linear approximation between 30.9 and 30.95.\n\nAt x=30.9, y=954.81\n\nAt x=30.95, y=957.9025\n\nWe need to find x such that y=957. So, the difference between 957 and 954.81 is 2.19.\n\nThe total difference between 957.9025 and 954.81 is 3.0925.\n\nSo, the fraction is 2.19 / 3.0925 ≈ 0.707. So, x ≈ 30.9 + 0.707*(0.05) ≈ 30.9 + 0.03535 ≈ 30.93535.\n\nSo, sqrt(957) ≈ 30.935.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(616) ≈24.8194, sqrt(957)≈30.935.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(616)≈49.6388, 2*sqrt(957)≈61.87.\n\nTherefore, A² -58≈49.6388, B² -58≈61.87.\n\nSo, B² -58 is larger, so B² > A². Therefore, B > A. So, sqrt(29) + sqrt(33) is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(44).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check my calculations again.\n\nCalculating sqrt(14) + sqrt(44):\n\nsqrt(14)≈3.7417, sqrt(44)≈6.6332, sum≈10"

    "generated_text": "Alright, let's see. I have to compare sqrt(2) + sqrt(24) and sqrt(8) + sqrt(20). Hmm, okay. I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't always play nicely with addition. Maybe I should try to simplify these radicals first to see if that helps.\n\nStarting with sqrt(24). I remember that 24 can be factored into 4 and 6, and 4 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(24) is equal to sqrt(4*6), which is sqrt(4)*sqrt(6) = 2*sqrt(6). Okay, so sqrt(24) simplifies to 2*sqrt(6). \n\nNow, let's look at sqrt(20). Similarly, 20 can be factored into 4 and 5, right? So, sqrt(20) is sqrt(4*5) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(5) = 2*sqrt(5). So, sqrt(20) simplifies to 2*sqrt(5). \n\nSo, rewriting both expressions with the simplified radicals:\n\nsqrt(2) + sqrt(24) becomes sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6).\n\nsqrt(8) + sqrt(20) becomes 2*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(5).\n\nHmm, so now we have:\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6)\n\nExpression 2: 2*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(5)\n\nI need to figure out which one is larger. Maybe I can subtract one from the other and see if the result is positive or negative. That way, I can tell which expression is larger.\n\nLet me denote Expression 1 as A = sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6) and Expression 2 as B = 2*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(5). So, I need to compute A - B and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nCalculating A - B:\n\nA - B = [sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6)] - [2*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(5)]\n\nLet's distribute the subtraction:\n\n= sqrt(2) - 2*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6) - 2*sqrt(5)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= (-sqrt(2)) + 2*sqrt(6) - 2*sqrt(5)\n\nSo, A - B = -sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6) - 2*sqrt(5)\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can compute each term numerically to see which is larger.\n\nLet's approximate each square root:\n\nsqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142\n\nsqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495\n\nsqrt(5) ≈ 2.2361\n\nSo, plugging these approximated values into A - B:\n\nA - B ≈ -1.4142 + 2*(2.4495) - 2*(2.2361)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*(2.4495) ≈ 4.899\n\n2*(2.2361) ≈ 4.4722\n\nSo, now:\n\nA - B ≈ -1.4142 + 4.899 - 4.4722\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nFirst, -1.4142 + 4.899 ≈ 3.4848\n\nThen, 3.4848 - 4.4722 ≈ -0.9874\n\nSo, A - B ≈ -0.9874, which is negative. That means Expression 1 (A) is less than Expression 2 (B). So, sqrt(2) + sqrt(24) is smaller than sqrt(8) + sqrt(20).\n\nBut wait, the question says to write down which is larger in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, from my calculation, sqrt(8) + sqrt(20) is larger. But let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, check the simplification:\n\nsqrt(24) is sqrt(4*6) = 2*sqrt(6). That seems correct.\n\nsqrt(20) is sqrt(4*5) = 2*sqrt(5). That also seems correct.\n\nSo, A = sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6), B = 2*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(5). Correct.\n\nCalculating A - B:\n\nsqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6) - 2*sqrt(2) - 2*sqrt(5) = (-sqrt(2)) + 2*sqrt(6) - 2*sqrt(5). That's correct.\n\nApproximate values:\n\nsqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142\n\nsqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495\n\nsqrt(5) ≈ 2.2361\n\nSo, -1.4142 + 2*(2.4495) - 2*(2.2361) = -1.4142 + 4.899 - 4.4722 ≈ -0.9874. Correct.\n\nSo, A is less than B. Therefore, sqrt(8) + sqrt(20) is larger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can square both expressions to compare them.\n\nLet me compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nFirst, A = sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(6). So, A^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 + (2*sqrt(6))^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*2*sqrt(6)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(sqrt(2))^2 = 2\n\n(2*sqrt(6))^2 = 4*(6) = 24\n\n2*sqrt(2)*2*sqrt(6) = 4*sqrt(12). Wait, sqrt(12) can be simplified as 2*sqrt(3), so 4*sqrt(12) = 4*2*sqrt(3) = 8*sqrt(3). \n\nSo, A^2 = 2 + 24 + 8*sqrt(3) = 26 + 8*sqrt(3)\n\nSimilarly, B = 2*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(5). So, B^2 = (2*sqrt(2))^2 + (2*sqrt(5))^2 + 2*(2*sqrt(2))*(2*sqrt(5))\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(2*sqrt(2))^2 = 4*2 = 8\n\n(2*sqrt(5))^2 = 4*5 = 20\n\n2*(2*sqrt(2))*(2*sqrt(5)) = 8*sqrt(10)\n\nSo, B^2 = 8 + 20 + 8*sqrt(10) = 28 + 8*sqrt(10)\n\nNow, compare A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 = 26 + 8*sqrt(3)\n\nB^2 = 28 + 8*sqrt(10)\n\nCompute 8*sqrt(3) ≈ 8*1.732 ≈ 13.856\n\nCompute 8*sqrt(10) ≈ 8*3.162 ≈ 25.296\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 26 + 13.856 ≈ 39.856\n\nB^2 ≈ 28 + 25.296 ≈ 53.296\n\nSo, B^2 is significantly larger than A^2, which means B > A. Therefore, sqrt(8) + sqrt(20) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(24).\n\nThat's consistent with my earlier conclusion. So, I can be confident that sqrt(8) + sqrt(20) is larger.\n\nBut, just for thoroughness, let me see if there's another way to compare these radicals without squaring them. Maybe by comparing term by term or using other properties.\n\nLooking at the original expressions:\n\nsqrt(2) + sqrt(24) vs sqrt(8) + sqrt(20)\n\nI notice that sqrt(24) is larger than sqrt(20), but sqrt(8) is larger than sqrt(2). So, it's a balance between adding a larger radical versus adding a smaller one. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider expressing everything in terms of sqrt(2). Let's see:\n\nsqrt(24) = sqrt(4*6) = 2*sqrt(6). Hmm, which isn't directly in terms of sqrt(2), but sqrt(6) can be expressed as sqrt(2*3) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). So, sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). Similarly, sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). So, let's rewrite both expressions in terms of sqrt(2):\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(2) +"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out which is larger: sqrt(17) + sqrt(48) or sqrt(35) + sqrt(36). Hmm, okay. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when comparing two expressions with square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help eliminate the square roots and make it easier to compare. But I also have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extra solutions or make things more complicated. Still, let's try that approach.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(17) + sqrt(48) and B = sqrt(35) + sqrt(36). I need to compare A and B.\n\nSo, if I square both A and B, I can compare them more easily. Let's compute A squared and B squared.\n\nStarting with A squared:\nA² = (sqrt(17) + sqrt(48))²\nUsing the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², we get:\nA² = (sqrt(17))² + 2*sqrt(17)*sqrt(48) + (sqrt(48))²\nCalculating each term:\nsqrt(17)² = 17\nsqrt(48)² = 48\nSo, the first and last terms are 17 and 48, adding up to 65.\n\nNow, the middle term is 2*sqrt(17*48). Let me compute 17*48. Hmm, 17*48 is the same as (20 - 3)*48 = 20*48 - 3*48 = 960 - 144 = 816. So, sqrt(816). Hmm, 816 is 16*51, which is 16*3*17. So, sqrt(816) = sqrt(16*51) = 4*sqrt(51). Therefore, the middle term is 2*4*sqrt(51) = 8*sqrt(51).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\nA² = 17 + 8*sqrt(51) + 48 = 65 + 8*sqrt(51)\n\nNow, moving on to B squared:\nB² = (sqrt(35) + sqrt(36))²\nAgain, using the same expansion:\nB² = (sqrt(35))² + 2*sqrt(35)*sqrt(36) + (sqrt(36))²\nCalculating each term:\nsqrt(35)² = 35\nsqrt(36)² = 36\nSo, the first and last terms are 35 and 36, adding up to 71.\n\nThe middle term is 2*sqrt(35*36). Let's compute 35*36. 35*36 is (30 + 5)*36 = 30*36 + 5*36 = 1080 + 180 = 1260. So, sqrt(1260). Hmm, 1260 is 36*35, which is 36*35. Wait, 35 is 5*7, so 1260 is 36*35 = 36*5*7 = 180*7 = 1260. So, sqrt(1260) = sqrt(36*35) = 6*sqrt(35).\n\nTherefore, the middle term is 2*6*sqrt(35) = 12*sqrt(35).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\nB² = 35 + 12*sqrt(35) + 36 = 71 + 12*sqrt(35)\n\nNow, to compare A² and B², which is which? So A² is 65 + 8*sqrt(51) and B² is 71 + 12*sqrt(35). Hmm, need to figure out which is larger.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values to get a better sense.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(51). sqrt(49) is 7, sqrt(64) is 8, so sqrt(51) is approximately 7.1414.\n\nThen, 8*sqrt(51) is approximately 8*7.1414 ≈ 57.1312.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 65 + 57.1312 ≈ 122.1312.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(35). sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(35) is approximately 5.9161.\n\nThen, 12*sqrt(35) is approximately 12*5.9161 ≈ 70.9932.\n\nSo, B² ≈ 71 + 70.9932 ≈ 141.9932.\n\nWait, hold on. That can't be right because 71 + 70.9932 is 141.9932, but A² was approximately 122.1312. That suggests that B² is larger, which would mean B is larger than A. But before I jump to conclusions, let me double-check my calculations because 141.9932 seems a bit high.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the computation of B².\n\nWait, I was told that sqrt(35) is approximately 5.9161, so 12*sqrt(35) is approximately 12*5.9161 ≈ 70.9932.\n\nThen, adding 35 + 36 is 71, so 71 + 70.9932 is indeed approximately 141.9932. So, B² is approximately 141.9932 and A² is approximately 122.1312. So, B² is larger, which would mean that B is larger than A.\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive because sqrt(35) is less than sqrt(48) and sqrt(36) is 6. So, sqrt(35) + sqrt(36) is 6 + sqrt(35), while sqrt(17) + sqrt(48) is sqrt(17) + sqrt(48). So, since sqrt(48) is about 6.9282 and sqrt(17) is about 4.1231. So, A is roughly 4.1231 + 6.9282 ≈ 11.0513, while B is 6 + 5.9161 ≈ 11.9161. So, indeed, B is larger than A.\n\nBut according to the squares, B² is larger, so B is indeed larger. So, the answer should be sqrt(35) + sqrt(36), which is written as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), so a is 35, b is 36.\n\nBut wait, hold on, let me double-check the calculations because 141.9932 seems quite large compared to 122.1312, but when I think about sqrt(35) is about 5.916, so 5.916 + 6 is 11.916, which is about 11.9, and sqrt(17) is about 4.123, sqrt(48) is about 6.928, so 4.123 + 6.928 is about 11.051. So, 11.916 is indeed larger than 11.051.\n\nTherefore, B is larger. So, in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), that would be sqrt(35) + sqrt(36), so the answer is \\boxed{\\sqrt{35} + \\sqrt{36}}.\n\nBut hold on, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in squaring or in the initial steps. Let me verify A² and B² calculations once more.\n\nFor A²: (sqrt(17) + sqrt(48))² = 17 + 2*sqrt(17*48) + 48. 17 + 48 is 65, and sqrt(17*48). 17*48 is 816, which is 16*51, so sqrt(16*51) is 4*sqrt(51). So, 2*sqrt(16*51) is 8*sqrt(51). So, A² = 65 + 8*sqrt(51). That's correct.\n\nFor B²: (sqrt(35) + sqrt(36))² = 35 + 2*sqrt(35*36) + 36. 35 +"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) is larger than sqrt(30) + sqrt(32) or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can compare the two sums by squaring them? That might make it easier to handle the square roots. But wait, squaring sums of square roots can get complicated because of the cross terms. Let me write down both expressions first:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(26) + sqrt(42)\nExpression B: sqrt(30) + sqrt(32)\n\nI need to determine if A > B or A < B. If I square both A and B, I can compare them without dealing with the square roots directly. Let me compute (A)^2 and (B)^2.\n\nCompute (A)^2:\n(sqrt(26) + sqrt(42))^2 = (sqrt(26))^2 + 2*sqrt(26)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))^2\n= 26 + 2*sqrt(26*42) + 42\n= 68 + 2*sqrt(1092)\n\nCompute (B)^2:\n(sqrt(30) + sqrt(32))^2 = (sqrt(30))^2 + 2*sqrt(30)*sqrt(32) + (sqrt(32))^2\n= 30 + 2*sqrt(960) + 32\n= 62 + 2*sqrt(960)\n\nWait, now I need to compare A^2 and B^2, which is 68 + 2*sqrt(1092) vs. 62 + 2*sqrt(960). Let me subtract 62 from both sides to simplify:\n\n(68 - 62) + 2*sqrt(1092) vs. 2*sqrt(960)\n6 + 2*sqrt(1092) vs. 2*sqrt(960)\n\nI can factor out the 2 in the second term:\n\n6 + 2*sqrt(1092) vs. 2*sqrt(960)\nDivide both sides by 2 to make it simpler:\n\n3 + sqrt(1092) vs. sqrt(960)\n\nNow, I need to figure out whether 3 + sqrt(1092) is larger or smaller than sqrt(960). Let me compute the approximate values of these square roots to compare.\n\nFirst, sqrt(960). Since 31^2 is 961, which is just barely more than 960. So, sqrt(960) is just a little less than 31. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\n31^2 = 961, so sqrt(960) = sqrt(961 - 1) ≈ 31 - 1/(2*31) ≈ 31 - 1/62 ≈ 30.983. So sqrt(960) ≈ 30.983.\n\nNext, sqrt(1092). Let's see, 33^2 = 1089, which is 3 less than 1092. So sqrt(1092) is a little more than 33. Let me compute it:\n\n33^2 = 1089\n34^2 = 1156\n\nSo 1092 - 1089 = 3, so sqrt(1092) ≈ 33 + 3/(2*33) ≈ 33 + 3/66 ≈ 33 + 0.045 ≈ 33.045.\n\nSo sqrt(1092) ≈ 33.045.\n\nNow, 3 + sqrt(1092) ≈ 3 + 33.045 ≈ 36.045.\n\nCompare that to sqrt(960) ≈ 30.983.\n\nSo 36.045 > 30.983, which means that (A)^2 > (B)^2. Therefore, sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) > sqrt(30) + sqrt(32).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with square roots, approximations can be misleading. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare (sqrt(26) + sqrt(42)) and (sqrt(30) + sqrt(32)) by seeing how much each term contributes.\n\nLet me compute the differences between the two terms:\n\nIs sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) greater than sqrt(30) + sqrt(32)?\n\nLet me compute sqrt(42) - sqrt(32) and sqrt(30) - sqrt(26) separately.\n\nCompute sqrt(42) - sqrt(32):\n\nsqrt(42) ≈ 6.4807\nsqrt(32) ≈ 5.6568\nDifference ≈ 6.4807 - 5.6568 ≈ 0.8239\n\nCompute sqrt(30) - sqrt(26):\n\nsqrt(30) ≈ 5.4772\nsqrt(26) ≈ 5.0990\nDifference ≈ 5.4772 - 5.0990 ≈ 0.3782\n\nSo sqrt(42) - sqrt(32) ≈ 0.8239 and sqrt(30) - sqrt(26) ≈ 0.3782.\n\nBut that doesn't directly compare the sums. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, since both sqrt(42) and sqrt(32) are larger than sqrt(30) and sqrt(26) respectively, but the differences aren't the same. So, is the total sum sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) larger than sqrt(30) + sqrt(32)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider vectors or something, but that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider squaring both sides again but more carefully.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(26) + sqrt(42))^2 = 26 + 42 + 2*sqrt(26*42) = 68 + 2*sqrt(1092)\nSimilarly, (sqrt(30) + sqrt(32))^2 = 30 + 32 + 2*sqrt(30*32) = 62 + 2*sqrt(960)\n\nSo, as before, we have (A)^2 = 68 + 2*sqrt(1092)\nand (B)^2 = 62 + 2*sqrt(960)\n\nCompute the difference between these two squares:\n\n(A)^2 - (B)^2 = 68 - 62 + 2*sqrt(1092) - 2*sqrt(960) = 6 + 2*(sqrt(1092) - sqrt(960))\n\nSo, the question is whether 6 + 2*(sqrt(1092) - sqrt(960)) is positive or negative.\n\nWe can factor out the 2:\n\nsqrt(1092) - sqrt(960) = sqrt(960*(1 + (1092/960) - 1)) = sqrt(960*(1 + 132/960)) = sqrt(960*(1 + 11/80)) = sqrt(960*(91/80)) = sqrt(960*91/80) = sqrt(12*91) = sqrt(1092). Wait, that's going in circles.\n\nAlternatively, compute sqrt(1092) - sqrt(960):\n\nWe know that sqrt(1092) ≈ 33.045\nsqrt(960) ≈ 30.983\nDifference ≈ 33.045 - 30.983 ≈ 2.062\n\nSo, sqrt(1092) - sqrt(960) ≈ 2.062\n\nTherefore, (A)^2 - (B)^2 ≈ 6 + 2*(2.062) ≈ 6 + 4.124 ≈ 10.124 > 0\n\nHence, (A)^2 > (B)^2, so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) is larger than sqrt(30) + sqrt(32).\n\nBut wait, just to ensure, let me consider another approach. Maybe using the difference of the two sums.\n\nLet me denote S1 = sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) and S2 = sqrt(30) + sqrt(32).\n\nCompute S1 - S2 = sqrt(26) - sqrt(32) + sqrt(42) - sqrt(3"

Let me factor 84 to see if there are any square factors. 84 is 4*21, so sqrt(84) is sqrt(4*21) which is 2*sqrt(21). So, sqrt(84) = 2*sqrt(21). So, 2*sqrt(84) is 2*(2*sqrt(21)) = 4*sqrt(21). Hmm, maybe that helps.\n\nSo, Expression B squared is 20 + 4*sqrt(21).\n\nNow, comparing Expression A squared (17 + 2*sqrt(30)) and Expression B squared (20 + 4*sqrt(21)).\n\nI need to see which one is larger. Let me compute the numerical values of both to approximate and compare.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(30). sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(30) is about 5.477.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(30) is approximately 2*5.477 = 10.954.\n\nAdding that to 17: 17 + 10.954 = 27.954.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(21). sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(21) is about 4.583.\n\nSo, 4*sqrt(21) is approximately 4*4.583 = 18.333.\n\nAdding that to 20: 20 + 18.333 = 38.333.\n\nSo, Expression A squared is approximately 27.954, and Expression B squared is approximately 38.333. Since 38.333 > 27.954, that means Expression B is larger than Expression A.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should check if my approximations are correct.\n\nLet me verify sqrt(30):\n\n5.5² = 30.25, so sqrt(30) is slightly less than 5.5, maybe around 5.477. So, 2*5.477 is approximately 10.954. That seems correct.\n\nsqrt(21):\n\n4.5² is 20.25, so sqrt(21) is about 4.583. That seems right because 4.583² is approximately 21. So, 4*4.583 is about 18.333. Hmm, adding 20 gives 38.333.\n\nExpression A squared is 17 + 10.954 = 27.954. So, yes, 38.333 is greater than 27.954.\n\nTherefore, Expression B is larger than Expression A.\n\nSo, Expression B is sqrt(6) + sqrt(14), which is larger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, let me redo the squaring.\n\nExpression A squared:\n\nsqrt(2)^2 is 2, sqrt(15)^2 is 15, and the cross term is 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(15) which is 2*sqrt(30). So, 2 + 15 + 2*sqrt(30) = 17 + 2*sqrt(30). That seems right.\n\nExpression B squared:\n\nsqrt(6)^2 is 6, sqrt(14)^2 is 14, cross term is 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(14) which is 2*sqrt(84). 84 is 4*21, so sqrt(84) is 2*sqrt(21). Therefore, cross term is 2*(2*sqrt(21)) = 4*sqrt(21). So, 6 + 14 + 4*sqrt(21) = 20 + 4*sqrt(21). That also seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, squaring both expressions gives 17 + 2*sqrt(30) and 20 + 4*sqrt(21). Comparing these, 4*sqrt(21) is significantly larger than 2*sqrt(30). Given that 4*sqrt(21) is approximately 18.333, and 2*sqrt(30) is approximately 10.954, so adding to 20, 38.333.\n\nTherefore, Expression B squared is larger, so Expression B is larger than Expression A.\n\nHence, the larger number is sqrt(6) + sqrt(14). So, I should write that in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), which is already done, with a=6 and b=14.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is sqrt(6) + sqrt(14), which is boxed as per the instruction.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{14}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{15}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{14}\\), we can square both expressions and compare the results.\n\nFirst, we square \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{15}\\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{15})^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{15} + (\\sqrt{15})^2 = 2 + 2\\sqrt{30} + 15 = 17 + 2\\sqrt{30}\n\\]\n\nNext, we square \\(\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{14}\\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{14})^2 = (\\sqrt{6})^2 + 2\\sqrt{6}\\sqrt{14} + (\\sqrt{14})^2 = 6 + 2\\sqrt{84} + 14 = 20 + 2\\sqrt{84}\n\\]\n\nWe simplify \\(\\sqrt{84}\\) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{84} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 21} = 2\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(2\\sqrt{84} = 4\\sqrt{21}\\).

I remember that squaring can sometimes help with comparing sums of square roots.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(46) and B = sqrt(21) + sqrt(42). If I square both A and B, I can compare A² and B². If A² is greater than B², then A is greater than B, and vice versa. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me compute A²:\nA² = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(46))²\nI can expand this using the formula (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y². So,\nA² = (sqrt(14))² + 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(46) + (sqrt(46))²\nSimplify each term:\nsqrt(14) squared is 14,\nsqrt(46) squared is 46,\nand the middle term is 2*sqrt(14*46). Let me compute 14*46 first. 14*40 is 560, and 14*6 is 84, so 560 + 84 = 644. So, 2*sqrt(644). Hmm, let me leave it as 2*sqrt(644) for now.\n\nSo, A² = 14 + 46 + 2*sqrt(644) = 60 + 2*sqrt(644). Let me note that down.\n\nNow, let me compute B²:\nB² = (sqrt(21) + sqrt(42))²\nAgain, using the same formula:\nB² = (sqrt(21))² + 2*sqrt(21)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))²\nSimplify each term:\nsqrt(21) squared is 21,\nsqrt(42) squared is 42,\nand the middle term is 2*sqrt(21*42). Let me compute 21*42. 20*42 is 840, and 1*42 is 42, so 840 + 42 = 882. So, 2*sqrt(882). I'll leave that term as is for now.\n\nSo, B² = 21 + 42 + 2*sqrt(882) = 63 + 2*sqrt(882). Okay, so now I have A² = 60 + 2*sqrt(644) and B² = 63 + 2*sqrt(882).\n\nNow, I need to compare 60 + 2*sqrt(644) and 63 + 2*sqrt(882). Let me subtract 60 from both to simplify:\n\nA² - 60 = 2*sqrt(644)\nB² - 60 = 3 + 2*sqrt(882)\n\nSo now, we can compare 2*sqrt(644) and 3 + 2*sqrt(882). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but maybe I can compute each square root and see which is bigger.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(644). Hmm, 25² is 625, which is less than 644, and 26² is 676, which is more than 644. So sqrt(644) is somewhere between 25 and 26. Let me see, 25.5 squared is 650.25, which is still a bit higher than 644. 25.4 squared is 25.4*25.4. Let me compute that: 25*25 is 625, plus 0.4*25 is 10, plus 0.4*25 is another 10, and 0.4*0.4 is 0.16. So total is 625 + 10 + 10 + 0.16 = 645.16. Oh, that's actually over 644. So sqrt(644) is a bit less than 25.4.\n\nWait, let me compute 25.3 squared: 25 + 0.3. (25 + 0.3)^2 = 25² + 2*25*0.3 + 0.3² = 625 + 15 + 0.09 = 640.09. Hmm, that's less than 644. So sqrt(644) is between 25.3 and 25.4. Let's approximate it.\n\nThe difference between 645.16 (25.4²) and 644 is 1.16. So, from 25.4, to get to 644, we need to go back 1.16. Since each 0.1 increase in the square root increases the square by roughly 2*25.4*0.1 + 0.1² = 5.08 + 0.01 = 5.09 per 0.1 increase in sqrt. So, 1.16 / 5.09 ≈ 0.228. So, sqrt(644) ≈ 25.4 - 0.228 ≈ 25.172.\n\nSo, sqrt(644) ≈ 25.172. Therefore, 2*sqrt(644) ≈ 50.344.\n\nNow, let's compute 2*sqrt(882). Similarly, 25² is 625, 26² is 676, so sqrt(882) is between 26 and something. Wait, 26² is 676, 27² is 729, which is too high. So sqrt(882) is between 26 and 27. Let's compute 26.5²: 26 + 0.5. (26 + 0.5)^2 = 26² + 2*26*0.5 + 0.5² = 676 + 26 + 0.25 = 702.25. That's way higher than 882.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, 26*26 is 676, 27*27 is 729, so sqrt(882) is between 26 and 27. Let me compute 26.5² is 702.25, which is more than 882. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the original numbers. A² = 60 + 2*sqrt(644). So sqrt(644) is about 25.172, so 2*sqrt(644) is about 50.344, so A² is 60 + 50.344 = 110.344.\n\nSimilarly, B² is 63 + 2*sqrt(882). So let me compute sqrt(882). Let me see, 29² is 841, 30² is 900, so sqrt(882) is between 29 and 30. Let me compute 29.5²: 29 + 0.5. (29.5)^2 = 29² + 2*29*0.5 + 0.5² = 841 + 29 + 0.25 = 870.25. That's still less than 882. So sqrt(882) is between 29.5 and 30.\n\nCompute 29.75²: (29 + 0.75)^2 = 29² + 2*29*0.75 + 0.75² = 841 + 43.5 + 0.5625 = 885.0625. That's more than 882. So sqrt(882) is between 29.5 and 29.75.\n\nCompute 29.6²: (29 + 0.6)^2 = 841 + 2*29*0.6 + 0.6² = 841 + 34.8 + 0.36 = 876.16. Still less than 882.\n\nCompute 29.65²: "

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(7) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(23) + sqrt(36). The goal is to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should simplify sqrt(50) because that looks like it can be broken down into something with a square root. Let me recall, sqrt(50) is the same as sqrt(25*2), right? So that's sqrt(25)*sqrt(2) which is 5*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(50) simplifies to 5*sqrt(2). That might make things easier later on.\n\nSo now, the first expression, sqrt(7) + sqrt(50), can be rewritten as sqrt(7) + 5*sqrt(2). The second expression is sqrt(23) + sqrt(36). Wait, sqrt(36) is straightforward because 36 is a perfect square. So sqrt(36) is 6. That means the second expression simplifies to sqrt(23) + 6.\n\nSo now, I have two expressions: one is sqrt(7) + 5*sqrt(2) and the other is sqrt(23) + 6. I need to figure out which one is larger. Hmm, I think one way to compare these is to square both expressions because squaring can sometimes make it easier to see which is larger, and since all the terms are positive, the larger square will correspond to the larger original number.\n\nLet me denote the first expression as A = sqrt(7) + 5*sqrt(2) and the second expression as B = sqrt(23) + 6.\n\nSo, if I square both A and B, I can compare them.\n\nStarting with A squared: (sqrt(7) + 5*sqrt(2))². I remember that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so applying that here:\n\nA² = (sqrt(7))² + 2*sqrt(7)*5*sqrt(2) + (5*sqrt(2))².\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(7))² is 7.\n\n2*sqrt(7)*5*sqrt(2) is 2*5*sqrt(7*2) = 10*sqrt(14). Let me check that: sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) is sqrt(14), so 2*5*sqrt(14) is indeed 10*sqrt(14).\n\nThen, (5*sqrt(2))² is 25*(sqrt(2))², which is 25*2 = 50.\n\nSo adding those together: 7 + 50 + 10*sqrt(14). That simplifies to 57 + 10*sqrt(14).\n\nNow, onto B squared: (sqrt(23) + 6)². Again, using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(23))² + 2*sqrt(23)*6 + 6².\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(23))² is 23.\n\n2*sqrt(23)*6 is 12*sqrt(23).\n\n6² is 36.\n\nSo adding those together: 23 + 36 + 12*sqrt(23) = 59 + 12*sqrt(23).\n\nOkay, so now we have A² = 57 + 10*sqrt(14) and B² = 59 + 12*sqrt(23). To compare A and B, we compare A² and B².\n\nSo, let me write that down:\n\nA² = 57 + 10*sqrt(14)\n\nB² = 59 + 12*sqrt(23)\n\nI need to figure out which one is larger. Let's compute both A² and B² numerically to get a sense.\n\nFirst, compute 10*sqrt(14). I know sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417. Multiplying that by 10 gives about 37.417.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 57 + 37.417 = 94.417.\n\nNext, compute 12*sqrt(23). sqrt(23) is approximately 4.7958. Multiplying by 12 gives about 57.55.\n\nSo, B² ≈ 59 + 57.55 = 116.55.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. 59 + 57.55 is 116.55? But A² was 94.417 and B² is 116.55. That would mean B² is larger, so B is larger than A. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because sqrt(23) is less than sqrt(25) which is 5, and sqrt(14) is about 3.7417, which is less than 4. So, maybe my initial intuition was right, but let me verify the calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in computing sqrt(23). Let me double-check. sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(23) is a bit less, like 4.7958. So 4.7958 * 12: 4*12=48, 0.7958*12≈9.5496, so total is 48 + 9.5496≈57.5496. So that part was correct.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417, times 10 is 37.417, correct.\n\nSo A² is 57 + 37.417≈94.417, B² is 59 + 57.5496≈116.5496.\n\nSo yes, B² is larger, which means B is larger than A.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this again because sqrt(23) is about 4.796, so sqrt(23) + 6 is about 10.796, and sqrt(7) is about 2.6458, so sqrt(7) + sqrt(50) is about 2.6458 + 7.071≈9.7168. So, 10.796 vs 9.7168. So, indeed, B is larger.\n\nBut wait, is my calculation of A² and B² correct? Let me check.\n\nA²: (sqrt(7) + 5*sqrt(2))².\n\nsqrt(7) is approx 2.6458, 5*sqrt(2) is approx 5*1.4142≈7.071. So adding those together: 2.6458 + 7.071≈9.7168. Squaring that: 9.7168²≈94.417. That's correct.\n\nB²: (sqrt(23) + 6)².\n\nsqrt(23)≈4.7958, so adding 6 gives≈10.7958. Squaring that:≈10.7958²≈116.549. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, B² is larger, so B is larger than A.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, in this case, B is sqrt(23) + 6, which is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) where a=23 and b=36 (since sqrt(36)=6). So, that's the answer.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's another way to compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(23) + sqrt(36) without squaring. Maybe using some inequality or approximating.\n\nI know that sqrt(7) is about 2.6458, sqrt(50) is about 7.0711. So adding them gives≈9.7169.\n\nOn the other hand, sqrt(23) is≈4.7958, sqrt(36)=6. So adding them gives≈10.7958.\n\nSo again, 10.7958 is larger than 9.7169.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(23) + sqrt(36) by seeing which combination is larger.\n\nBut I think squaring both expressions is the standard method for comparing sums of square roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think about the difference: if we compute sqrt(23) + 6 and sqrt(7) + sqrt(50), which is larger.\n\nBut"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(15) + sqrt(32) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(28), and figure out which one is larger. Hmm, I remember that sometimes when you have square roots, you can compare them by squaring both expressions. Maybe that will work here. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me write down both expressions:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(15) + sqrt(32)\n\nExpression B: sqrt(18) + sqrt(28)\n\nI need to figure out which one is bigger. Maybe if I square both, I can compare the results and see which is larger. But wait, squaring both expressions might not just tell me definitively which one is larger because they both have square roots, so squaring might make it bigger or smaller depending on the original values. Hmm, but I think it's still a good start.\n\nSo, let's square both A and B.\n\nFirst, squaring Expression A:\n\n(A)^2 = (sqrt(15) + sqrt(32))^2\n\nI remember that (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, so applying that here:\n\n(A)^2 = (sqrt(15))^2 + 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(32) + (sqrt(32))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(15))^2 is 15.\n\nSimilarly, (sqrt(32))^2 is 32.\n\nAnd the middle term is 2*sqrt(15*32). Let me compute 15*32. 15*30 is 450 and 15*2 is 30, so 450 + 30 = 480. So, 2*sqrt(480).\n\nSimplify sqrt(480). I can factor 480 as 16*30, so sqrt(16*30) = sqrt(16)*sqrt(30) = 4*sqrt(30). Therefore, 2*sqrt(480) is 2*4*sqrt(30) = 8*sqrt(30).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n(A)^2 = 15 + 8*sqrt(30) + 32\n\nSimplify the constants: 15 + 32 = 47\n\nSo, (A)^2 = 47 + 8*sqrt(30)\n\nSimilarly, let's square Expression B:\n\n(B)^2 = (sqrt(18) + sqrt(28))^2\n\nAgain, using the same formula:\n\n(B)^2 = (sqrt(18))^2 + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))^2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(sqrt(18))^2 is 18.\n\n(sqrt(28))^2 is 28.\n\nMiddle term is 2*sqrt(18*28). Let's compute 18*28. 10*28 is 280, 8*28 is 224, so 280 + 224 = 504. Therefore, sqrt(504).\n\nSimplify sqrt(504). Let me factor 504: 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is not an integer. Wait, 504 is 16*31.5, which isn't helpful. Maybe 504 divided by 9 is 56. So, sqrt(504) is sqrt(9*56) which is 3*sqrt(56). But sqrt(56) can be simplified further as sqrt(4*14) = 2*sqrt(14). Therefore, sqrt(504) is 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14).\n\nHence, the middle term is 2*sqrt(504) which is 2*6*sqrt(14) = 12*sqrt(14).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(B)^2 = 18 + 12*sqrt(14) + 28\n\nSimplify the constants: 18 + 28 = 46\n\nSo, (B)^2 = 46 + 12*sqrt(14)\n\nNow, I have both squared terms:\n\n(A)^2 = 47 + 8*sqrt(30)\n\n(B)^2 = 46 + 12*sqrt(14)\n\nI need to compare these two. Since both are in the form of a constant plus a multiple of a square root, I can compare the constants first, and then the coefficients of the square roots. But I also need to consider the actual numerical values because sometimes even if constants are similar, the coefficients can be such that one expression is larger despite the constants being a bit lower.\n\nLet me compute approximate numerical values for each term to see which is larger.\n\nFirst, compute (A)^2:\n\n47 + 8*sqrt(30)\n\nCompute sqrt(30). I know that sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(36) is 6. 30 is closer to 25, so sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477.\n\nSo, 8*sqrt(30) is 8*5.477 ≈ 43.816\n\nThus, (A)^2 ≈ 47 + 43.816 ≈ 90.816\n\nNow, compute (B)^2:\n\n46 + 12*sqrt(14)\n\nCompute sqrt(14). I know sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417.\n\nThus, 12*sqrt(14) is 12*3.7417 ≈ 44.900\n\nSo, (B)^2 ≈ 46 + 44.900 ≈ 90.900\n\nSo, (A)^2 ≈ 90.816 and (B)^2 ≈ 90.900\n\nComparing these, 90.816 < 90.900, so (A)^2 < (B)^2\n\nTherefore, since both expressions squared are positive, the expression with the smaller squared value is the smaller expression.\n\nThus, Expression A is less than Expression B, so sqrt(15) + sqrt(32) < sqrt(18) + sqrt(28)\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(18) + sqrt(28). So, I need to write that in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), which is already given as sqrt(18) + sqrt(28). Alternatively, maybe I can see if sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) can be simplified further, but I don't think it's necessary because the problem just asks for the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) can be simplified.\n\nsqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2) = 3*sqrt(2)\n\nsqrt(28) is sqrt(4*7) = 2*sqrt(7)\n\nSo, sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) = 3*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(7). If I leave it in this form, it's probably fine, but the problem just asks for the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, unless I can combine them or write it differently, but I don't think so. So, perhaps just leaving it as is is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to present it without factoring, but I think either form is acceptable. Since the question says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)\", so 3*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(7) would be the expression, but sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) is the form.\n\nWait, but 3*sqrt(2) is not a single sqrt term, unless you can write it as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, but 3*sqrt(2) is the same as sqrt(9*2) = sqrt(18), so sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) is the original expression.\n\nSo, perhaps in that case, the answer is just sqrt(18) + sqrt(28). Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to write it as sqrt(18) + sqrt(28), so that is already in the desired form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should write it as 3*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(7) but that's not the same as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Because sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) would have the same form as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is sqrt(18) + sqrt(28). However, just to make sure, maybe I should check if there's another way to compare sqrt(15) + sqrt(32) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) without squaring, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare each term individually. For example, compare sqrt(1"

Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down the two expressions we're comparing:\n\n1. sqrt(1) + sqrt(44)\n2. sqrt(17) + sqrt(36)\n\nI think it might help to calculate their approximate numerical values. That way, I can compare them more easily.\n\nStarting with the first expression: sqrt(1) is straightforward, that's just 1. What about sqrt(44)? Hmm, sqrt(44) is the square root of 44. I know that sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(44) must be somewhere between 6 and 7. Let me figure that out more precisely.\n\nCalculating sqrt(44):\n\n44 is 4 times 11, so sqrt(44) = sqrt(4 * 11) = 2*sqrt(11). I know that sqrt(11) is approximately 3.3166, so 2*sqrt(11) is about 6.6332. So, sqrt(44) ≈ 6.6332.\n\nTherefore, the first expression: sqrt(1) + sqrt(44) ≈ 1 + 6.6332 = 7.6332.\n\nNow, the second expression: sqrt(17) + sqrt(36).\n\nI know that sqrt(36) is 6, so I just need to find sqrt(17). Let me approximate that.\n\n17 is between 16 and 25, so sqrt(17) is between 4 and 5. Let me see, 4 squared is 16, 5 squared is 25. Let me try 4.1 squared: 4.1 * 4.1 = 16.81. That's still less than 17. So, 4.1 squared is 16.81, which is just under 17. Let's try 4.12 squared: 4.12 * 4.12.\n\nCalculating 4 * 4 = 16, 4 * 0.12 = 0.48, 0.12 * 4 = 0.48, and 0.12 * 0.12 = 0.0144. So, adding those up: 16 + 0.48 + 0.48 + 0.0144 = 16.9744. That's pretty close to 17. So, 4.12 squared is approximately 16.9744. Therefore, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.1231. (I remember that sqrt(17) is about 4.1231, but let me verify that with a calculator in my mind.)\n\nSo, sqrt(17) ≈ 4.1231, so sqrt(17) + sqrt(36) ≈ 4.1231 + 6 = 10.1231.\n\nWait, hold on, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.1231, which I just thought of, so adding that to 6 gives 10.1231. Hmm, that seems way too high compared to the first expression's 7.6332. Maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nWait, sqrt(44) is approximately 6.6332, so 1 + 6.6332 is 7.6332. That makes sense. But sqrt(17) is approximately 4.1231, so 4.1231 + 6 is 10.1231. So, 10.1231 is definitely larger than 7.6332. So, sqrt(17) + sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating sqrt(17). Let me double-check that.\n\nCalculating sqrt(17):\n\nI know that 4.1 squared is 16.81, as above.\n\n4.12 squared is 16.9744, which is still less than 17.\n\n4.13 squared: Let's calculate that.\n\n4.13 * 4.13:\n\nFirst, 4 * 4 = 16.\n\n4 * 0.13 = 0.52.\n\n0.13 * 4 = 0.52.\n\n0.13 * 0.13 = 0.0169.\n\nAdding them up: 16 + 0.52 + 0.52 + 0.0169 = 16 + 1.04 + 0.0169 = 17.0569.\n\nWait, so 4.13 squared is 17.0569, which is just over 17.\n\nSo, sqrt(17) is between 4.12 and 4.13. Let's find a more precise approximation.\n\nWe know that 4.12 squared is 16.9744, and 4.13 squared is 17.0569.\n\nWe need to find x such that x^2 = 17, where x is between 4.12 and 4.13.\n\nDifference between 17.0569 and 16.9744 is 0.0825. We need to find how much more beyond 4.12 gives us 17.\n\nSo, 17 - 16.9744 = 0.0256.\n\nSo, the fraction is 0.0256 / 0.0825 ≈ 0.3108.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(17) ≈ 4.12 + 0.3108 * 0.01 ≈ 4.12 + 0.0031 ≈ 4.1231.\n\nSo, yes, approximately 4.1231. So, sqrt(17) + sqrt(36) ≈ 4.1231 + 6 = 10.1231.\n\nWhereas sqrt(1) + sqrt(44) ≈ 1 + 6.6332 = 7.6332.\n\nSo, 10.1231 is definitely larger than 7.6332. So, sqrt(17) + sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nWait, but let me think again because sometimes when you approximate, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions and compare them. That might be a more accurate way because squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, so if I square both, the larger one will still be larger.\n\nSo, let me square both expressions.\n\nFirst expression: (sqrt(1) + sqrt(44))² = (1 + 2*sqrt(1)*sqrt(44) + 44) = 1 + 2*sqrt(44) + 44 = 45 + 2*sqrt(44).\n\nSecond expression: (sqrt(17) + sqrt(36))² = (17 + 2*sqrt(17)*sqrt(36) + 36) = 17 + 2*sqrt(612) + 36 = 53 + 2*sqrt(612).\n\nNow, to compare (45 + 2*sqrt(44)) and (53 + 2*sqrt(612)).\n\nLet me compute both expressions:\n\nFirst expression squared: 45 + 2*sqrt(44) ≈ 45 + 2*6.6332 ≈ 45 + 13.2664 ≈ 58.2664.\n\nSecond expression squared: 53 + 2*sqrt(612) ≈ 53 + 2*24.7387 ≈ 53 + 49.4774 ≈ 102.4774.\n\nSo, 58.2664 vs. 102.4774.\n\nClearly, 102.4774 is bigger than 58.2664. Therefore, the second expression squared is larger, meaning the original expression sqrt(17) + sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that sqrt(17) + sqrt(36) is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(44). So, the answer should be sqrt(17) + sqrt(36).\n\nBut just to make absolutely sure, let me verify the approximate values again.\n\nsqrt(1"

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(4) is just 2, right? So sqrt(4) + sqrt(46) is 2 + sqrt(46). Similarly, sqrt(15) + sqrt(41) is sqrt(15) + sqrt(41). So, I need to compare 2 + sqrt(46) and sqrt(15) + sqrt(41). To make it easier, maybe I can subtract one from the other and see if the result is positive or negative.\n\nLet me denote A = 2 + sqrt(46) and B = sqrt(15) + sqrt(41).

That means A is less than B. So, sqrt(4) + sqrt(46) is smaller than sqrt(15) + sqrt(41).\n\nWait, but I should make sure these approximations are accurate enough. Let me verify the square roots more precisely.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(15):\n\nsqrt(15) is sqrt(9 + 6) = approximately 3.872983346.\n\nsqrt(41):\n\nsqrt(41) is sqrt(36 + 5) = approximately 6.40312424.\n\nsqrt(46):\n\nsqrt(46) is sqrt(49 - 3) = approximately 6.78232998.\n\nSo, plugging back into A - B:\n\n2 - 3.872983346 + 6.78232998 - 6.40312424.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n2 - 3.872983346 = -1.872983346.\n\n-1.872983346 + 6.78232998 = 4.909346634.\n\n4.909346634 - 6.40312424 = -1.493777606.\n\nSo, yes, approximately -1.4938, which is still negative. So, A - B is negative, meaning A < B.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider another approach. Maybe squaring both sides to compare A and B.\n\nLet me denote A = 2 + sqrt(46) and B = sqrt(15) + sqrt(41). If I square both, I can compare A² and B².\n\nCompute A² = (2 + sqrt(46))² = 4 + 4*sqrt(46) + 46 = 50 + 4*sqrt(46).\n\nCompute B² = (sqrt(15) + sqrt(41))² = 15 + 2*sqrt(15*41) + 41 = 56 + 2*sqrt(615).\n\nSo now, we have to compare 50 + 4*sqrt(46) and 56 + 2*sqrt(615).\n\nLet me compute 50 + 4*sqrt(46) and 56 + 2*sqrt(615).\n\nFirst, 4*sqrt(46):\n\nsqrt(46) is about 6.78232998, so 4*6.78232998 ≈ 27.1293199.\n\nSo, 50 + 27.1293199 ≈ 77.1293199.\n\nNow, 2*sqrt(615):\n\nsqrt(615) is sqrt(625 - 10) = sqrt(625) is 25, so sqrt(615) is a bit less than 25, approximately 24.799242.\n\nSo, 2*24.799242 ≈ 49.598484.\n\nThus, B² ≈ 56 + 49.598484 ≈ 105.598484.\n\nWhile A² ≈ 77.1293199.\n\nSo, since A² ≈ 77.13 < B² ≈ 105.60, that means A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(4) + sqrt(46) is less than sqrt(15) + sqrt(41).\n\nSo, the larger number is sqrt(15) + sqrt(41), which I can write as sqrt(15) + sqrt(41). So, I just need to write that in the box.\n\nWait, before I finalize, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nCompute A²: (2 + sqrt(46))².\n\n2 squared is 4, sqrt(46) squared is 46, and cross term is 2*2*sqrt(46) = 4*sqrt(46).

So, 50 + 27.1293199 ≈ 77.1293199.\n\nCompute 2*sqrt(615): sqrt(615) is approximately 24.799242, so 2*24.799242 ≈ 49.598484. So, 56 + 49.598484 ≈ 105.598484. Correct.\n\nSo, since 77.1293199 is less than 105.598484, A² < B², so A < B. So, sqrt(4) + sqrt(46) is less than sqrt(15) + sqrt(41). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(15) + sqrt(41).\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute A and B as decimals to compare.\n\nCompute A = 2 + sqrt(46):\n\nsqrt(46) ≈ 6.78232998, so A ≈ 2 + 6.78232998 ≈ 8.78232998.\n\nCompute B = sqrt(15) + sqrt(41):\n\nsqrt(15) ≈ 3.872983346, sqrt(41) ≈ 6.40312424.\n\nSo, B ≈ 3.872983346 + 6.40312424 ≈ 10.27610759.\n\nSo, A ≈ "

Both involve adding two square roots, so maybe I can calculate each one numerically to see which is larger? That seems straightforward, but I wonder if there's a smarter way without calculating decimals.\n\nWait, let me think. Sometimes, when dealing with square roots, inequalities can be tricky, but maybe I can find a way to compare them without adding the roots. Maybe by squaring both expressions? That often helps with inequalities because squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nA = sqrt(17) + sqrt(49)\nB = sqrt(33) + sqrt(47)\n\nI need to compare A and B. Let me square both A and B to see what happens.\n\nStarting with A squared:\n\nA² = (sqrt(17) + sqrt(49))²\n= (sqrt(17))² + 2*sqrt(17)*sqrt(49) + (sqrt(49))²\n= 17 + 2*sqrt(17*49) + 49\n= 17 + 2*sqrt(833) + 49\n= 66 + 2*sqrt(833)\n\nSimilarly, let me compute B squared:\n\nB² = (sqrt(33) + sqrt(47))²\n= (sqrt(33))² + 2*sqrt(33)*sqrt(47) + (sqrt(47))²\n= 33 + 2*sqrt(33*47) + 47\n= 33 + 2*sqrt(1551) + 47\n= 80 + 2*sqrt(1551)\n\nNow, I have A² = 66 + 2*sqrt(833)\nand B² = 80 + 2*sqrt(1551)\n\nI need to compare these two squared terms to see which is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can subtract A² from B² or vice versa to see the difference.\n\nLet me compute B² - A²:\n\nB² - A² = (80 + 2*sqrt(1551)) - (66 + 2*sqrt(833))\n= (80 - 66) + 2*sqrt(1551) - 2*sqrt(833)\n= 14 + 2*(sqrt(1551) - sqrt(833))\n\nHmm, so it's 14 plus twice the difference of the square roots. Since sqrt(1551) is larger than sqrt(833), this difference is positive. Therefore, B² - A² is positive, which implies that B² > A², so B > A.\n\nWait, does that mean sqrt(33) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(17) + sqrt(49)? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, 17 + 49 is 66, yes. The term 2*sqrt(17*49) is 2*sqrt(833). I can compute sqrt(833) approximately to see if it's about 28.86, because 28² is 784 and 29² is 841, so sqrt(833) is about 28.86.\n\nSimilarly, 33 + 47 is 80, and 2*sqrt(33*47) is 2*sqrt(1551). sqrt(1551) is a bit less than 39.38, since 39² is 1521 and 40² is 1600. So, sqrt(1551) is approximately 39.38.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(1551) is about 78.76.\n\nThus, B² is 80 + 78.76 ≈ 158.76\nA² is 66 + 2*28.86 ≈ 66 + 57.72 ≈ 123.72\n\nSo, 158.76 - 123.72 ≈ 35.04, which is positive. So, B² is indeed larger than A², so B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(33) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(17) + sqrt(49).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is by considering the differences.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = sqrt(17) + sqrt(49)\nB = sqrt(33) + sqrt(47)\n\nI wonder if there's a relationship between 17 and 33, and between 49 and 47. Let's see:\n\n17 and 33: 17 + 49 = 66, 33 + 47 = 80.\n\nSo, A is sqrt(17) + sqrt(49), which is sqrt(17) + 7, since sqrt(49) is 7.\n\nSimilarly, B is sqrt(33) + sqrt(47).\n\nSo, maybe I can write both A and B in terms of sqrt(x) + sqrt(y), and see if I can find a relation.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a function. Let me think of f(x) = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), and see how it behaves as x and y change.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider how sqrt(x) behaves as x increases. The square root function is concave, so the difference between sqrt(x+1) and sqrt(x) decreases as x increases.\n\nTherefore, maybe sqrt(33) is closer to sqrt(36) = 6 than sqrt(17) is to sqrt(16) = 4. Similarly, sqrt(47) is closer to sqrt(49) = 7 than sqrt(43) is to sqrt(49).\n\nWait, but 33 is 5 more than 28, which is 4*7. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps considering the distances from perfect squares.\n\nWait, 17 is 9 + 8, and 49 is 49, which is 7 squared. 33 is 25 + 8, and 47 is 49 - 2.\n\nSo, sqrt(33) is sqrt(25 + 8), which is sqrt(25 + 8) = sqrt(25 + 8). Similarly, sqrt(47) is sqrt(49 - 2).\n\nSo, perhaps using the tangent line approximation for sqrt(x) around x = 25 and x = 49.\n\nWait, maybe I can use linear approximation.\n\nLet me recall that for a function f(x) = sqrt(x), the derivative is f'(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)). So, the tangent line at x = a is f(a) + f'(a)*(x - a).\n\nTherefore, for sqrt(33), we can approximate it as sqrt(25) + (1/(2*sqrt(25)))*(33 - 25) = 5 + (1/10)*8 = 5 + 0.8 = 5.8.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(47): sqrt(49) + (1/(2*sqrt(49)))*(47 - 49) = 7 + (1/14)*(-2) = 7 - 1/7 ≈ 7 - 0.1429 ≈ 6.8571.\n\nBut wait, sqrt(33) is actually less than 5.8? Wait, 5.8 squared is 33.64. So, sqrt(33) is approximately 5.7446.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(47) is less than 6.8571. Let me compute 6.8571 squared: 6² is 36, 0.8571² is about 0.734, and cross term is 2*6*0.8571≈10.285. So total is 36 + 10.285 + 0.734 ≈ 47.019, which is close to 47. So sqrt(47) is approximately 6.855.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(33) is approximately 5.7446.\n\nSo, A is sqrt(17) + 7. Let's compute sqrt(17): 4.1231, so A ≈ 4.1231 + 7 = 11.1231.\n\nB is sqrt(33) + sqrt(47) ≈ 5.7446 + 6."

Hmm, not too bad, but I should take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes when comparing sums of square roots, squaring both sides can help because it simplifies the comparison. But I also recall that squaring can sometimes introduce errors if not done carefully, so I need to be cautious.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(21) + sqrt(43) and B = sqrt(22) + sqrt(40). I need to figure out if A > B or B > A.\n\nIf I square both A and B, I can compare A² and B². Let's do that.\n\nA² = (sqrt(21) + sqrt(43))² = 21 + 43 + 2*sqrt(21*43). Similarly, B² = (sqrt(22) + sqrt(40))² = 22 + 40 + 2*sqrt(22*40).\n\nCalculating the constants first:\n\nFor A²: 21 + 43 = 64, and 2*sqrt(21*43).

Let me approximate these values.\n\nFirst, sqrt(900) is 30, so sqrt(903) is approximately 30 + (3)/ (2*sqrt(900)) = 30 + 3/(60) = 30 + 0.05 = 30.05. Similarly, sqrt(880) is sqrt(900 - 20) which is approximately sqrt(900) - (20)/(2*sqrt(900)) = 30 - 10/60 = 30 - 1/6 ≈ 29.8333.\n\nHence, sqrt(903) - sqrt(880) ≈ 30.05 - 29.8333 ≈ 0.2167.\n\nSo, A² - B² ≈ 2 + 2*(0.2167) = 2 + 0.4334 ≈ 2.4334, which is positive. Therefore, A² > B², so A > B.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure my approximations are correct. Maybe I should use a better method to compute sqrt(903) and sqrt(880) to have a more accurate estimate.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute sqrt(903) and sqrt(880) more precisely. For that, I can use linear approximation or use a calculator method.\n\nLet me calculate sqrt(903):\n\nLet x = 903, and let's find sqrt(x). Let's note that 30² = 900, so sqrt(900) = 30. Then, sqrt(903) is a bit more than 30. Let's find the linear approximation.\n\nLet’s take f(x) = sqrt(x), f'(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)). Let x₀ = 900, f(x₀) = 30, f'(x₀) = 1/(2*30) = 1/60.\n\nSo, f(903) ≈ f(900) + f'(900)*(903 - 900) = 30 + (1/60)*3 = 30 + 0.05 = 30.05. So, that's consistent with my previous approximation.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(880):\n\nAgain, let x = 880, x₀ = 900, same as above.\n\nf(x) = sqrt(x), f'(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)).\n\nSo, f(880) ≈ f(900) + f'(900)*(880 - 900) = 30 + (1/60)*(-20) = 30 - (20/60) = 30 - 1/3 ≈ 29.6667.\n\nSo, sqrt(880) ≈ 29.6667.\n\nThus, sqrt(903) ≈ 30.05, sqrt(880) ≈ 29.6667.\n\nSo, sqrt(903) - sqrt(880) ≈ 30.05 - 29.6667 ≈ 0.3833.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous estimate. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in my first estimation, I thought sqrt(880) ≈ 29.8333, but in the linear approximation, it's 29.6667. Which is more accurate?\n\nI think the linear approximation is better because it's closer to 900, so maybe that's a better estimate. Let me check sqrt(880) using the linear approximation.\n\nWait, actually, sqrt(880) is less than sqrt(900)=30, so linear approximation should give a lower estimate, which is 29.6667, which is lower than 29.8333. So, 30.05 - 29.6667 ≈ 0.3833.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(903) - sqrt(880) ≈ 0.3833.\n\nSo then, A² - B² ≈ 2 + 2*(0.3833) = 2 + 0.7666 ≈ 2.7666, which is still positive. Therefore, A² > B², so A > B.\n\nWait, but I just realized that perhaps my initial step is wrong. I squared both sides, but is there a case where squaring might introduce an error?\n\nBut in this case, since both A and B are positive, squaring should preserve the inequality.\n\nSo, A > B.\n\nWait, hold on, but I'm not sure. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute sqrt(21) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(22) + sqrt(40) numerically.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nsqrt(21) ≈ 4.58366\n\nsqrt(43) ≈ 6.55743\n\nsqrt(22) ≈ 4.69042\n\nsqrt(40) ≈ 6.32456\n\nSo, A ≈ 4.58366 + 6.55743 ≈ 11.14109\n\nB ≈ 4.69042 + 6.32456 ≈ 11.01498\n\nTherefore, A ≈ 11.14109, B ≈ 11.01498, so A > B.\n\nHence, sqrt(21) + sqrt(43) is larger than sqrt(22) + sqrt(40).\n\nSo, the answer is sqrt(21) + sqrt(43).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the exact decimal values more accurately.\n\nCompute sqrt(21):\n\nsqrt(21) = 4.583666... Let me compute it more precisely:\n\n4.583666^2 = (4 + 0.583666)^2 = 16 + 2*4*0.583666 + (0.583666)^2 ≈ 16 + 4.669328 + 0.3407 ≈ 21.0099... Hmm, that's a bit over "

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(32) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(34) + sqrt(41). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't follow the same rules as adding regular numbers. Maybe I can find a way to simplify or approximate these values to see which sum is bigger.\n\nLet me start by calculating each square root individually. I remember that sqrt(32) is the same as sqrt(16*2), which is 4*sqrt(2). Similarly, sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2), which is 5*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(32) + sqrt(50) is 4*sqrt(2) + 5*sqrt(2). That simplifies to (4 + 5)*sqrt(2) = 9*sqrt(2). Okay, that's a start.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(34) + sqrt(41). I don't think these can be simplified as neatly, so maybe I should approximate their values. Let's recall that sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(34) must be a little less than 6. Similarly, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(41) is a bit less than 7. Let me try to approximate these.\n\nFor sqrt(34): Since 5.8 squared is 33.64, which is very close to 34. So, sqrt(34) is approximately 5.83. Let me check: 5.83 squared is 5.83 * 5.83. Hmm, 5*5 is 25, 5*0.83 is 4.15, 0.83*5 is another 4.15, and 0.83*0.83 is about 0.6889. Adding those up: 25 + 4.15 + 4.15 + 0.6889 ≈ 33.9889, which is very close to 34. So, sqrt(34) ≈ 5.83.\n\nNow, for sqrt(41): 6.4 squared is 40.96, which is just a bit less than 41. So, sqrt(41) is approximately 6.403. Let me verify: 6.403 squared is approximately 6.403 * 6.403. Let's compute it step by step: 6*6 = 36, 6*0.403 = 2.418, 0.403*6 = 2.418, and 0.403*0.403 ≈ 0.1624. Adding all these together: 36 + 2.418 + 2.418 + 0.1624 ≈ 41.0. Perfect, so sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403.\n\nSo, sqrt(34) + sqrt(41) ≈ 5.83 + 6.403 ≈ 12.233.\n\nEarlier, we found that sqrt(32) + sqrt(50) = 9*sqrt(2). Let me compute 9*sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so 9*1.4142 ≈ 12.7278.\n\nSo, comparing the two sums: 12.7278 vs. 12.233. Clearly, 12.7278 is larger. Therefore, sqrt(32) + sqrt(50) is larger.\n\nWait a second, hold on. I approximated sqrt(34) as 5.83 and sqrt(41) as 6.403, but maybe there's a more precise way to compare these sums without approximating so much? Because the problem asks to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, maybe instead of approximating, I can find exact bounds or use some algebraic manipulation.\n\nLet me try squaring both expressions to see which one is larger. Let me denote A = sqrt(32) + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(34) + sqrt(41). Then, to compare A and B, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and see which is larger.\n\nCalculating A^2: (sqrt(32) + sqrt(50))^2 = 32 + 2*sqrt(32*50) + 50. Let's compute that step by step: 32 + 50 = 82. Then, 2*sqrt(32*50). Let's find 32*50 = 1600. sqrt(1600) is 40. So, 2*40 = 80. Therefore, A^2 = 82 + 80 = 162.\n\nNow, calculating B^2: (sqrt(34) + sqrt(41))^2 = 34 + 2*sqrt(34*41) + 41. Again, let's compute that: 34 + 41 = 75. Then, 2*sqrt(34*41). Let's compute 34*41: 34*40 = 1360, plus 34*1 = 34, so total is 1394. sqrt(1394) is approximately, let's see: 37^2 is 1369, 38^2 is 1444. So, sqrt(1394) is between 37 and 38. Let's approximate it: 37.3^2 = 1391.29, 37.4^2 = 1398.76. So, sqrt(1394) ≈ 37.33.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(1394) ≈ 2*37.33 ≈ 74.66. So, B^2 ≈ 75 + 74.66 ≈ 149.66.\n\nTherefore, A^2 is 162 and B^2 is approximately 149.66. Since 162 > 149.66, that means A > B. Hence, sqrt(32) + sqrt(50) is larger than sqrt(34) + sqrt(41).\n\nWait, but hold on, I did it this way. But the problem says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, in this case, it's sqrt(32) + sqrt(50). But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you approximate sqrt(1394), it's important to be precise.\n\nLet me compute 37^2 = 1369, 38^2=1444. So, 1394 - 1369 = 25, so sqrt(1394) is 37 + 25/(2*37) approximately, using linear approximation. So, 25/(74) ≈ 0.338. So, sqrt(1394) ≈ 37.338.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(1394) ≈ 74.676. Hence, B^2 ≈ 75 + 74.676 ≈ 149.676. So, A^2 is 162, which is indeed larger. Therefore, A > B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method to compare sqrt(32)+sqrt(50) and sqrt(34)+sqrt(41) without squaring. But I think squaring is a valid method here because both expressions are positive, so squaring preserves the inequality.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the difference between the two sums: A - B = sqrt(32) + sqrt(50) - sqrt(34) - sqrt(41). Maybe I can find this difference and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nBut that might be more complicated because it involves subtracting square roots. So, perhaps the squaring method is the simplest.\n\nWait, but let me think again: if A^2 is 162 and B^2 is about 149.66, then A is sqrt(162) and B is sqrt(149.66). Since sqrt(162) > sqrt(149.66), which confirms that A > B. So, the conclusion is that sqrt(32) + sqrt(50) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, to make it more precise, maybe I"

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should calculate both expressions numerically to get a sense of their values. That might help me see which one is bigger without having to deal with complicated algebra. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with sqrt(3). I remember sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. Now, sqrt(38). Hmm, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(38) is a bit more than 6, maybe around 6.164? Let me check with a calculator: 6.164 squared is about 38. So, sqrt(38) ≈ 6.164.\n\nSo, sqrt(3) + sqrt(38) ≈ 1.732 + 6.164 ≈ 7.896.\n\nNow, sqrt(24) + sqrt(36). sqrt(36) is 6, which is straightforward. sqrt(24) is a bit less than 5, since 5 squared is 25. Let me compute sqrt(24): 4.899. So, sqrt(24) + sqrt(36) ≈ 4.899 + 6 ≈ 10.899.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. 4.899 + 6 is 10.899? But that would mean sqrt(24) is about 4.899, which is correct because 4.899 squared is approximately 24. So, 4.899 + 6 is 10.899. But sqrt(3) + sqrt(38) is only 7.896. So, 7.896 is less than 10.899. Therefore, sqrt(24) + sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because 10.899 seems quite large compared to sqrt(38) being just over 6.164. Maybe my approximation of sqrt(24) is off?\n\nLet me compute sqrt(24) more accurately. 4.899 squared is (4 + 0.899)^2 = 16 + 2*4*0.899 + (0.899)^2 = 16 + 7.192 + 0.808 ≈ 24. So, 4.899 squared is approximately 24. Therefore, sqrt(24) is indeed approximately 4.899.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(38): 6.164 squared is 6^2 + 2*6*0.164 + (0.164)^2 = 36 + 1.968 + 0.026 ≈ 37.994, which is very close to 38. So, sqrt(38) is approximately 6.164.\n\nSo, 1.732 + 6.164 is indeed about 7.896. And sqrt(24) + sqrt(36) is 4.899 + 6 = 10.899. So, 10.899 is larger than 7.896. Therefore, sqrt(24) + sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nBut wait a second, is there a way to compare these without approximating? Maybe by squaring both expressions? Let me try that.\n\nLet’s denote A = sqrt(3) + sqrt(38) and B = sqrt(24) + sqrt(36). I want to see if A < B or A > B.\n\nIf I square both A and B, I can compare them algebraically. Let me compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(3) + sqrt(38))^2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(38) + 38 = 41 + 2*sqrt(114).\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(24) + sqrt(36))^2 = 24 + 2*sqrt(24)*sqrt(36) + 36 = 60 + 2*sqrt(864).\n\nSo, now we have A^2 = 41 + 2*sqrt(114) and B^2 = 60 + 2*sqrt(864).\n\nTo compare A and B, we can compare A^2 and B^2. So, which is larger: 41 + 2*sqrt(114) or 60 + 2*sqrt(864)?\n\nSubtract 41 from both sides: 2*sqrt(114) vs. 19 + 2*sqrt(864).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let me compute the numerical values.\n\nCompute sqrt(114): sqrt(100) is 10, sqrt(121) is 11, so sqrt(114) is approximately 10.677.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(114) ≈ 21.354.\n\nAdding to 41: 41 + 21.354 ≈ 62.354.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(864): sqrt(841) is 29, since 29^2 is 841. 29^2 = 841, 30^2 = 900. 864 is 23 more than 841, so sqrt(864) is approximately 29.4.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(864) ≈ 58.8.\n\nAdding to 60: 60 + 58.8 ≈ 118.8.\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 62.354 and B^2 ≈ 118.8.\n\nSince 62.354 < 118.8, it follows that A^2 < B^2, so A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(24) + sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nWait, so in the initial approximation, I thought B was around 10.899 and A was around 7.896, so that's consistent with B > A. So, that seems to check out.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me do one more check. Maybe compare sqrt(38) and sqrt(24) individually.\n\nsqrt(38) is about 6.164, sqrt(24) is about 4.899. So, the difference between sqrt(24) and sqrt(38) is about 1.265. But when we add them together, it's significant because we have sqrt(3) which is about 1.732, so 1.732 + 6.164 is about 7.896, whereas sqrt(24) is 4.899 and sqrt(36) is 6, so 4.899 + 6 is 10.899.\n\nSo, even though sqrt(24) is less than sqrt(38), when added to sqrt(36), which is 6, the total is significantly larger than when we add sqrt(3) with sqrt(38).\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let's see if sqrt(24) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(3) - sqrt(38) is positive or negative.\n\nCompute sqrt(24) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(3) - sqrt(38).\n\nCompute each term: sqrt(24) ≈ 4.899, sqrt(36) = 6, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(38) ≈ 6.164.\n\nAdding sqrt(24) and sqrt(36): 4.899 + 6 = 10.899.\n\nSubtract sqrt(3) and sqrt(38): 10.899 - 1.732 - 6.164 ≈ 10.899 - 7.896 ≈ 3.003.\n\nSo, the difference is approximately 3.003, which is positive. Therefore, sqrt(24) + sqrt(36) is larger by about 3.003.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way without doing the squaring? Maybe estimating the differences or using some inequality?\n\nI know that (a + b)^2 < (c + d)^2 if a < c and b < d, but in this case, it's not straightforward because both the terms are added to a common value.\n\nWait, in our"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) is larger than sqrt(18) + sqrt(36), or vice versa. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't behave the same way as regular numbers. So, maybe I should simplify each square root as much as possible to see if that helps.\n\nLet's start with sqrt(48). I know that 48 can be broken down into 16 times 3, since 16 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(48) is the same as sqrt(16*3). Using the property that sqrt(a*b) = sqrt(a)*sqrt(b), this becomes sqrt(16)*sqrt(3). And since sqrt(16) is 4, that simplifies to 4*sqrt(3). Cool, so sqrt(48) is 4*sqrt(3).\n\nNext, let's look at sqrt(36). That's straightforward because 36 is a perfect square. sqrt(36) is just 6. So, the second term in the expression sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) is 6.\n\nNow, let's see if I can do something similar with sqrt(10) and sqrt(18). Starting with sqrt(10), that doesn't break down into any perfect squares except 1 and 10, so it stays as sqrt(10). Moving on to sqrt(18): 18 can be broken down into 9*2, which is a perfect square. So, sqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2) which becomes sqrt(9)*sqrt(2). Since sqrt(9) is 3, this simplifies to 3*sqrt(2). Alright, so far, so good.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original expressions become:\n- sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) = sqrt(10) + 4*sqrt(3)\n- sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) = sqrt(10) + 3*sqrt(2) + 6\n\nNow, I need to compare these two expressions. The first thing I notice is that both have a sqrt(10) term. So, if I subtract sqrt(10) from both, I can simplify the comparison to:\n- sqrt(48) vs. sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10)\nWhich simplifies to:\n- 4*sqrt(3) vs. (sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10))\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe another approach would be better. Let's try to approximate the values numerically to see which is larger.\n\nStarting with sqrt(10): I know that sqrt(9) is 3, and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(10) must be somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me recall that sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623.\n\nNext, sqrt(48) is 4*sqrt(3). I know that sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 4*1.732 is approximately 6.928.\n\nSo, sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) is approximately 3.1623 + 6.928, which adds up to about 10.0903.\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10). We already know sqrt(36) is 6, and sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2). Let me approximate sqrt(2): that's about 1.4142, so 3*1.4142 is approximately 4.2426. So, sqrt(18) is about 4.2426.\n\nThus, sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) is 4.2426 + 6, which is 10.2426. Then, subtracting sqrt(10) which is 3.1623, we get 10.2426 - 3.1623 = 7.0803.\n\nWait, hold on. That can't be right. Because in the initial comparison, I subtracted sqrt(10) from both expressions and ended up with sqrt(48) vs. sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10). But when I approximated, I got sqrt(48) ≈ 6.928 and sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10) ≈ 7.0803. So, 6.928 is less than 7.0803, which would mean that sqrt(48) is less than sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10). But that doesn't make sense because when I subtracted sqrt(10) from both, I had to compare sqrt(48) with sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10). If sqrt(48) is less than that number, does that mean the original sqrt(48) is less than sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10), or is it?\n\nWait, maybe I confused myself. Let's clarify:\n\nOriginal expressions:\nA = sqrt(10) + sqrt(48)\nB = sqrt(18) + sqrt(36)\n\nWe subtract sqrt(10) from both:\nA - sqrt(10) = sqrt(48)\nB - sqrt(10) = sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10)\n\nSo, we can compare sqrt(48) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10). If sqrt(48) is less than that, then A < B, meaning sqrt(48) is smaller.\n\nBut according to our approximate calculations:\nsqrt(48) ≈ 6.928\nsqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10) ≈ 10.2426 - 3.1623 ≈ 7.0803\n\nSo, 6.928 < 7.0803, which would imply that sqrt(48) is less than sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) - sqrt(10). Therefore, A < B, meaning sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) is less than sqrt(18) + sqrt(36).\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when you subtract, the direction can flip. Let me double-check:\n\nWe have A = sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) ≈ 3.1623 + 6.928 ≈ 10.0903\nB = sqrt(18) + sqrt(36) ≈ 4.2426 + 6 ≈ 10.2426\n\nSo, A ≈ 10.0903, B ≈ 10.2426. Comparing these, 10.0903 < 10.2426, which means A < B. So, sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) is less than sqrt(18) + sqrt(36).\n\nTherefore, sqrt(10) + sqrt(48) is smaller than sqrt(18) + sqrt(36). So, the larger number is sqrt(18) + sqrt(36).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me try another approach without approximating. Maybe squaring both expressions to compare them.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(10) + sqrt(48)\nand B = sqrt(18) + sqrt(36)\n\nCompute A^2 and B^2 and compare them.\n\nCompute A^2:\n(sqrt(10) + sqrt(48))^2 = (sqrt(10))^2 + 2*sqrt(10)*sqrt(48) + (sqrt(48))^2\n= 10 + 2*sqrt(480) + 48\n= 58 + 2*sqrt(480)\n\nCompute B^2:\n(sqrt(18) + sqrt(36))^2 = (sqrt(18))^2 + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(36) + (sqrt(36))^2\n= 18 + 2*sqrt(648) + 36\n= 54 + 2*sqrt(648)\n\nNow, compute sqrt(480) and sqrt(648):\n\nsqrt(480) can be simplified as sqrt(16*30) = 4*sqrt(30)\nsqrt(648) can be simplified as sqrt(36*18) = 6*sqrt(18)\n\nSo, substituting back:\nA^2 = 58 + 2*(4*sqrt(30)) = 58 + 8*sqrt(30)\nB^2 = 54"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) and sqrt(6) + sqrt(17) and figure out which one is larger. Hmm, I remember from school that sometimes you can compare these kinds of expressions by squaring them. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me denote A = sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) and B = sqrt(6) + sqrt(17). If I can find out whether A is greater than B or vice versa, I can figure out which one is larger.\n\nSince both A and B are sums of square roots, squaring them might help. Let me compute A squared and B squared.\n\nStarting with A squared:\nA² = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(31))²\n= (sqrt(2))² + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(31) + (sqrt(31))²\n= 2 + 2*sqrt(62) + 31\n= 33 + 2*sqrt(62)\n\nSimilarly, for B squared:\nB² = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(17))²\n= (sqrt(6))² + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(17) + (sqrt(17))²\n= 6 + 2*sqrt(102) + 17\n= 23 + 2*sqrt(102)\n\nSo now I have A² = 33 + 2*sqrt(62) and B² = 23 + 2*sqrt(102). To compare A and B, I can compare A² and B².\n\nSo which is larger between 33 + 2*sqrt(62) and 23 + 2*sqrt(102)? Let me subtract 23 from both sides to make it simpler.\n\nSo, 33 - 23 + 2*sqrt(62) vs. 2*sqrt(102)\nWhich is 10 + 2*sqrt(62) vs. 2*sqrt(102)\n\nNow, I can factor out a 2:\n2*(5 + sqrt(62)) vs. 2*sqrt(102)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n5 + sqrt(62) vs. sqrt(102)\n\nSo now I need to compare 5 + sqrt(62) and sqrt(102). Hmm, let's compute sqrt(62) and sqrt(102) to see which is larger.\n\nI know that sqrt(64) is 8, so sqrt(62) is just a little less than 8, maybe around 7.87 or something. Similarly, sqrt(100) is 10, so sqrt(102) is a bit more than 10, maybe 10.1 or 10.2.\n\nLet me get approximate values:\n\nsqrt(62): 7.874 (since 7.874² ≈ 62)\nsqrt(102): 10.0995 (since 10.0995² ≈ 102)\n\nSo 5 + sqrt(62) ≈ 5 + 7.874 ≈ 12.874\n\nAnd sqrt(102) ≈ 10.0995\n\nTherefore, 12.874 is definitely larger than 10.0995.\n\nSo that means 5 + sqrt(62) > sqrt(102). Thus, 2*(5 + sqrt(62)) > 2*sqrt(102), meaning A² > B².\n\nSince both A and B are positive numbers, the square of the larger one is also larger. Therefore, A > B.\n\nSo sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(17).\n\nBut wait, just to double-check, maybe I made a mistake in the approximations? Let me verify.\n\nCompute 5 + sqrt(62):\n\nsqrt(62) is approximately 7.874, so 5 + 7.874 is indeed 12.874.\n\nsqrt(102) is approximately 10.0995, so 10.0995 is less than 12.874. So yes, 12.874 is greater.\n\nThus, A squared is greater than B squared, so A is greater than B.\n\nHence, sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) is larger. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(2) + sqrt(31).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can try another approach to compare the two expressions without squaring, just to cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the difference between sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) and sqrt(6) + sqrt(17). Let me compute sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) - sqrt(6) - sqrt(17) and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nSo, compute D = sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) - sqrt(6) - sqrt(17).\n\nI can try to approximate each term:\n\nsqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142\n\nsqrt(31) ≈ 5.56776\n\nsqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495\n\nsqrt(17) ≈ 4.1231\n\nSo, plug these in:\n\nD ≈ 1.4142 + 5.56776 - 2.4495 - 4.1231\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n1.4142 + 5.56776 = 6.98196\n\n2.4495 + 4.1231 = 6.5726\n\nSo, D ≈ 6.98196 - 6.5726 ≈ 0.40936\n\nWhich is positive. So, D is positive, meaning sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) is indeed larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(17).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is consistent. So, sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) is the larger number.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think if there's another method. Maybe using inequalities or something else.\n\nI remember that for positive numbers, if a > c and b > d, then a + b > c + d. But in this case, it's not just adding single numbers, but square roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) can be compared by their squares, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, squaring is a reliable method here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think about pairing terms: sqrt(2) vs sqrt(6) and sqrt(31) vs sqrt(17). Let me see:\n\nsqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, so sqrt(2) < sqrt(6)\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(31) ≈ 5.568, sqrt(17) ≈ 4.123, so sqrt(31) > sqrt(17)\n\nSo, sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) is greater than sqrt(6) + sqrt(17) because the positive term is larger. But wait, that reasoning is not necessarily correct because sqrt(2) is less than sqrt(6) but sqrt(31) is much more than sqrt(17). Maybe the difference is more significant.\n\nBut in any case, since when we square both expressions, we get a clear result, that sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) is larger. So, the approximate difference is about 0.4.\n\nSo, yeah, confident now that sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) is larger.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps we can use the triangle inequality or something else? I don't think so, because the triangle inequality is about the sum of sides in a triangle, which isn't directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality? Let me recall that.\n\nBut I think the approach of squaring both sides is the most straightforward here, so unless there's a more clever method, that should be sufficient.\n\nHence, I think I can conclude that sqrt(2) + sqrt(31) is the larger number, so I can write that in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) with a and b being integers. So, in this case, a is 2 and b is 31.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)\". So, they might expect just the expression, but as a single sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), so that would be sqrt(2) + sqrt(31).\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want a different combination? Hmm, but since we've already compared them numerically, and A is bigger, so that should be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact difference, but that would involve more complex calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think in terms of distances on the number line, but I think that's complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, consider that sqrt(2) + sqrt(3"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(13) + sqrt(28). Hmm, which one is bigger? Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare since squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, right?\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) and B = sqrt(13) + sqrt(28). So, I need to compare A and B. If I square A, I get A² = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(43))². Similarly, B² = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(28))². Let me calculate both A² and B².\n\nCalculating A²:\nA² = (sqrt(7))² + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(43) + (sqrt(43))²\n= 7 + 2*sqrt(7*43) + 43\n= 50 + 2*sqrt(301)\n\nCalculating B²:\nB² = (sqrt(13))² + 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))²\n= 13 + 2*sqrt(13*28) + 28\n= 41 + 2*sqrt(364)\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B², which are 50 + 2*sqrt(301) and 41 + 2*sqrt(364). Let me subtract 41 from both to make it simpler:\n\nA² - 41 = 50 - 41 + 2*sqrt(301) = 9 + 2*sqrt(301)\nB² - 41 = 41 - 41 + 2*sqrt(364) = 0 + 2*sqrt(364) = 2*sqrt(364)\n\nSo now, I need to figure out whether 9 + 2*sqrt(301) is greater than or less than 2*sqrt(364). If 9 + 2*sqrt(301) is greater, then A² is greater, so A is greater than B. Otherwise, B is greater.\n\nLet me compute both terms:\n\nFirst, 2*sqrt(301). Let me approximate sqrt(301). I know that sqrt(289) is 17 and sqrt(324) is 18, so sqrt(301) should be between 17 and 18. Let me calculate 17.3² = 299.29, which is close to 301. So sqrt(301) is approximately 17.35.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(301) ≈ 2*17.35 ≈ 34.7.\n\nAdding 9 to that, 9 + 34.7 ≈ 43.7.\n\nNow, let's compute 2*sqrt(364). Similarly, sqrt(361) is 19, so sqrt(364) is a bit more. Let's calculate 19² = 361, so sqrt(364) is 19 + (364 - 361)/(2*19 + 1) ≈ 19 + 3/39 ≈ 19.077. So 2*sqrt(364) ≈ 2*19.077 ≈ 38.154.\n\nSo, 9 + 2*sqrt(301) ≈ 43.7 versus 2*sqrt(364) ≈ 38.154. So 43.7 is greater than 38.154. Therefore, A² is greater than B², which implies that A is greater than B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) is larger, and the answer should be written as sqrt(7) + sqrt(43).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try another method, like comparing the individual terms. Let me see if that works.\n\nSuppose I try to see if sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) > sqrt(13) + sqrt(28). Let me square both sides again:\n\n(sqrt(7) + sqrt(43))² > (sqrt(13) + sqrt(28))²\n50 + 2*sqrt(301) > 41 + 2*sqrt(364)\nWhich is the same as before, 9 + 2*sqrt(301) > 2*sqrt(364). So same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approximate the decimal values:\n\nCompute sqrt(7): approximately 2.6458\nCompute sqrt(43): approximately 6.5574\nSo sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) ≈ 2.6458 + 6.5574 ≈ 9.2032\n\nCompute sqrt(13): approximately 3.6056\nCompute sqrt(28): approximately 5.2915\nSo sqrt(13) + sqrt(28) ≈ 3.6056 + 5.2915 ≈ 8.8971\n\nSo 9.2032 is greater than 8.8971, so that confirms it.\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(13) + sqrt(28) by seeing how much each is larger than another term.\n\nBut perhaps that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of the sum of square roots and see if there's a way to compare.\n\nFor example, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) compared to sqrt(c) + sqrt(d). It's not straightforward, but sometimes you can square both sides and see which is larger.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the idea that for positive numbers x and y, sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) is less than sqrt(2(x + y)). Wait, is that true? Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) ≤ sqrt(2(x + y)). Hmm, let me test with numbers.\n\nTake x = y = 1: sqrt(1) + sqrt(1) = 2. sqrt(2(1 + 1)) = sqrt(4) = 2. So in this case, they are equal.\n\nTake x = 1, y = 4: sqrt(1) + sqrt(4) = 1 + 2 = 3. sqrt(2(1 + 4)) = sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16. So 3 < 3.16, so the inequality holds.\n\nSo generally, sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) ≤ sqrt(2(x + y)). So, we can use that.\n\nSo, let's apply that here.\n\nCompare sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) with sqrt(13) + sqrt(28).\n\nUsing the inequality: sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) ≤ sqrt(2(a + b)).\n\nSo, for sqrt(7) + sqrt(43), the upper bound is sqrt(2*(7 + 43)) = sqrt(2*50) = sqrt(100) = 10.\n\nSimilarly, for sqrt(13) + sqrt(28), the upper bound is sqrt(2*(13 + 28)) = sqrt(2*41) = sqrt(82) ≈ 9.055.\n\nSo, since 10 > sqrt(82) ≈ 9.055, but that doesn't directly tell me which is larger.\n\nWait, maybe I can pair the two sums in a different way.\n\nWait, another approach: compare (sqrt(7) + sqrt(43))² and (sqrt(13) + sqrt(28))².\n\nWe did that earlier and got 50 + 2*sqrt(301) vs 41 + 2*sqrt(364). So, same result.\n\nWait, another thought: sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) is approximately 9.2032, as I calculated earlier, and sqrt(13) + sqrt(28) is approximately 8.8971. So, 9.2032 is larger. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the difference between the two sums.\n\nLet me compute A - B = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(43)) - (sqrt(13) + sqrt(28)) ≈ 9.2032 - 8.8971 ≈ 0.3061. So, A is larger by approximately 0.3061.\n\nTherefore, A is larger.\n\nBut wait, is there a smarter way than calculating the approximate values? Maybe using inequalities or another method.\n\nLet me think.\n\nSuppose I consider sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(13) + sqrt(28). Let me see if I"

Both expressions involve adding two square roots, so I might need to compare them term by term or find another way.\n\nFirst, maybe I can compute the approximate values of each square root to get a sense of their sizes. Let me jot down the approximate square roots:\n\n- sqrt(21): Well, 4^2 is 16 and 5^2 is 25, so sqrt(21) is somewhere between 4 and 5. Let me calculate it more precisely. 4.5^2 is 20.25, which is pretty close to 21. So, sqrt(21) is approximately 4.5837.\n\n- sqrt(42): 6^2 is 36 and 7^2 is 49, so sqrt(42) is between 6 and 7. 6.5^2 is 42.25, which is just a bit over 42. So, sqrt(42) ≈ 6.4807.\n\n- sqrt(30): 5^2 is 25 and 6^2 is 36, so sqrt(30) is between 5 and 6. 5.5^2 is 30.25, which is just over 30. So, sqrt(30) ≈ 5.4772.\n\n- sqrt(39): 6^2 is 36 and 7^2 is 49, so sqrt(39) is between 6 and 7. 6.2^2 is 38.44, and 6.3^2 is 39.69, so sqrt(39) is between 6.2 and 6.3. Let me compute it more accurately. 6.24^2 is approximately 38.94, 6.25^2 is 39.0625. So, sqrt(39) ≈ 6.245.\n\nNow, let's compute the sums:\n\n- sqrt(21) + sqrt(42) ≈ 4.5837 + 6.4807 ≈ 11.0644\n- sqrt(30) + sqrt(39) ≈ 5.4772 + 6.245 ≈ 11.7222\n\nWait, hold on, 11.0644 is less than 11.7222. So, sqrt(30) + sqrt(39) is larger? Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought because when I look at sqrt(21) is a bit less than sqrt(30), but sqrt(42) is a bit more than sqrt(39). So, the square roots that are on the higher side might compensate for the lower ones.\n\nLet me verify my approximations because maybe I rounded too much. Maybe I should use more precise values.\n\nCalculating sqrt(21) more precisely:\n\n21 is between 16 (4^2) and 25 (5^2). Let's use linear approximation. The derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2*sqrt(x)). So, at x=16, sqrt(16)=4, and the slope is 1/(2*4)=0.125. So, sqrt(21) ≈ sqrt(16) + 0.125*(21-16) = 4 + 0.125*5 = 4 + 0.625 = 4.625. But actually, sqrt(21) is approximately 4.5837, so maybe my linear approximation is not accurate enough.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Newton-Raphson method to compute sqrt(21):\n\nLet me start with an initial guess of 4.5837.\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 21\n\nf'(x) = 2x\n\nCompute next iteration:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 4.5837 - (4.5837^2 - 21)/(2*4.5837)\n\nCompute 4.5837^2:\n\n4.5837 * 4.5837: Let's compute 4 * 4.5837 = 18.3348, 0.5837 * 4.5837 ≈ 2.671. So, total approx 18.3348 + 2.671 ≈ 21.0058. So, 4.5837^2 ≈ 21.0058\n\nThen, f(x0) = 21.0058 - 21 = 0.0058\n\nf'(x0) = 2*4.5837 ≈ 9.1674\n\nSo, x1 = 4.5837 - 0.0058 / 9.1674 ≈ 4.5837 - 0.00063 ≈ 4.58307\n\nSo, sqrt(21) ≈ 4.58307.

So, total≈36 + 2.94 + 0.060≈39.000. So, sqrt(39)≈6.245.\n\nBut wait, let's compute sqrt(30) more accurately. Let's use a better approximation.\n\nUsing x0 = 5.4772.\n\nf(x0)=x0^2 -30= (5.4772)^2 -30. Let's compute 5.4772^2.\n\n5^2=25, 0.4772^2≈0.2277, 2*5*0.4772≈4.772. So, 25 + 4.772 + 0.2277≈30.000. So, f(x0)=0.000, which is accurate.\n\nBut if I take x1=5.4772 + (30 - x0^2)/(2*x0). Since x0^2 is exactly 30, x1=5.4772.\n\nWait, that's not helpful. Maybe I need to take a more precise x0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the decimal expansion of sqrt(30). Let me recall that sqrt(25)=5, sqrt(30) is about 5.4772.\n\nBut perhaps I can use the continued fraction expansion or some iterative method, but that might be too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, use a calculator-like approach, but since I don't have one, perhaps I can use a better approximation.\n\nWait, sqrt(30) = sqrt(25 + 5) = 5*sqrt(1 + 0.2).

That should give me the answer, right?\n\nOkay, let's compute A² first:\nA² = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(39))²\nI can expand this using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b².\n\nSo, A² = (sqrt(7))² + 2 * sqrt(7) * sqrt(39) + (sqrt(39))²\nSimplifying each term:\n= 7 + 2 * sqrt(7*39) + 39\n= 7 + 2 * sqrt(273) + 39\n\nWait, 7 + 39 is 46, so:\nA² = 46 + 2 * sqrt(273)\n\nSimilarly, let's compute B²:\nB² = (sqrt(17) + sqrt(23))²\nAgain, using the same formula:\n= (sqrt(17))² + 2 * sqrt(17) * sqrt(23) + (sqrt(23))²\nSimplifying:\n= 17 + 2 * sqrt(17*23) + 23\n= 17 + 2 * sqrt(391) + 23\n\nAdding 17 and 23:\n= 40 + 2 * sqrt(391)\n\nSo now, I have both A² and B² expressed as:\nA² = 46 + 2 * sqrt(273)\nB² = 40 + 2 * sqrt(391)\n\nTo compare A² and B², I can subtract 40 from both to simplify:\nA² - 40 = 6 + 2 * sqrt(273)\nB² - 40 = 0 + 2 * sqrt(391)\n\nSo, now I need to compare 6 + 2 * sqrt(273) and 2 * sqrt(391).\n\nHmm, okay, let's compute both sides numerically to see which is larger.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(273):\nI know that 16² = 256 and 17² = 289, so sqrt(273) is between 16 and 17.\n\nLet me estimate sqrt(273):\n16² = 256\n273 - 256 = 17\nSo, sqrt(273) is approximately 16 + 17/(2*16) = 16 + 17/32 ≈ 16.53125\n\nWait, is that a good approximation? Maybe, but let's see:\n\nCompute 16.53125²:\n= (16 + 0.53125)²\n= 16² + 2*16*0.53125 + 0.53125²\n= 256 + 17.0 + 0.2822\n≈ 256 + 17.0 + 0.2822 ≈ 273.2822\n\nBut 273.2822 is actually a bit more than 273, so sqrt(273) is slightly less than 16.53125.\n\nLet me try 16.5²:\n16.5² = 272.25\n\nThat's very close to 273. So, 16.5² = 272.25\n16.53125² ≈ 273.2822\nSo, sqrt(273) is between 16.5 and 16.53125.\n\nTo get a better approximation, let's use linear approximation between 16.5 and 16.53125.\n\nThe difference between 16.53125 and 16.5 is 0.03125.\n\nAt 16.5, the square is 272.25\nAt 16.53125, it's approximately 273.2822.\n\nWe need to find x such that x² = 273. So, x is between 16.5 and 16.53125.\n\nLet’s denote x = 16.5 + d\n\nThen, (16.5 + d)^2 = 273\n272.25 + 2*16.5*d + d² = 273\n272.25 + 33d + d² = 273\nSo, 33d + d² = 0.75\n\nAssuming d is small, d² is negligible, so 33d ≈ 0.75 ⇒ d ≈ 0.75 / 33 ≈ 0.0227\n\nSo, x ≈ 16.5 + 0.0227 ≈ 16.5227\n\nLet me check 16.5227²:\n= (16.5 + 0.0227)²\n= 16.5² + 2*16.5*0.0227 + 0.0227²\n= 272.25 + 0.7797 + 0.00051289\n≈ 272.25 + 0.7797 + 0.00051289 ≈ 273.0302\n\nThat's pretty close. So, sqrt(273) ≈ 16.5227\n\nSo, 2 * sqrt(273) ≈ 2 * 16.5227 ≈ 33.0454\n\nAdding 6 to that: 6 + 33.0454 ≈ 39.0454\n\nNow, let's compute 2 * sqrt(391)\n\nSimilarly, let's find sqrt(391)\n\nI know that 19² = 361 and 20² = 400, so sqrt(391) is between 19 and 20.\n\nCompute 19² = 361\n391 - 361 = 30\n\nSo, let's try 19.5²:\n19.5² = (20 - 0.5)² = 400 - 20 + 0.25 = 380.25\n\nStill less than 391. So, sqrt(391) is between 19.5 and 20.\n\nCompute 19.75²:\n19.75² = (20 - 0.25)² = 400 - 10 + 0.0625 = 390.0625\n\nThat's very close to 391. So, sqrt(391) is approximately 19.75 + a little bit.\n\nCompute 19.75² = 390.0625\nSo, 391 - 390.0625 = 0.9375\n\nSo, how much more do I need to add to 19.75 to get to 391?\n\nLet’s let x = 19.75 + d\n\nThen, (19.75 + d)^2 = 390.0625 + 2*19.75*d + d² = 391\n\nSo, 390.0625 + 39.5d + d² = 391\n\nAgain, assuming d is small, d² is negligible, so 39.5d ≈ 0.9375\n\nThus, d ≈ 0.9375 / 39.5 ≈ 0.0237\n\nSo, x ≈ 19.75 + 0.0237 ≈ 19.7737\n\nCheck 19.7737²:\n\n= (19.7"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(20) + sqrt(43) is larger than sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare since squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(20) + sqrt(43) and B = sqrt(26) + sqrt(42). I need to compare A and B. If I square both A and B, I can get expressions that I can maybe compare more straightforwardly.\n\nSo, let's compute A² and B².\n\nFirst, A² = (sqrt(20) + sqrt(43))². Expanding that, I get:\n\nA² = (sqrt(20))² + 2*sqrt(20)*sqrt(43) + (sqrt(43))²\n    = 20 + 2*sqrt(20*43) + 43\n    = 63 + 2*sqrt(860)\n\nSimilarly, B² = (sqrt(26) + sqrt(42))².\n\nExpanding that, I get:\n\nB² = (sqrt(26))² + 2*sqrt(26)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))²\n    = 26 + 2*sqrt(26*42) + 42\n    = 68 + 2*sqrt(1092)\n\nSo now, I have A² = 63 + 2*sqrt(860) and B² = 68 + 2*sqrt(1092). I need to determine whether A² is greater than B² or not.\n\nLet me compute the difference A² - B²:\n\nA² - B² = (63 + 2*sqrt(860)) - (68 + 2*sqrt(1092))\n= (63 - 68) + 2*(sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092))\n= (-5) + 2*(sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092))\n\nSo, A² - B² = -5 + 2*(sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092)).\n\nTo see if A² is greater than B², I need to check if A² - B² > 0.\n\nSo, -5 + 2*(sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092)) > 0 ?\n\nLet me rearrange this inequality:\n\n2*(sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092)) > 5\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(860) - sqrt(1092) > 2.5\n\nSo, sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092) > 2.5 ?\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive because 860 is less than 1092. So, sqrt(860) is less than sqrt(1092). So, their difference would be negative, right? So, sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092) is negative, which would make the inequality sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092) > 2.5 false.\n\nBut that would mean A² - B² < 0, which implies that A² < B², so A < B.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems contradictory. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, A² = 63 + 2*sqrt(860)\n\nB² = 68 + 2*sqrt(1092)\n\nSo, A² - B² = (63 - 68) + 2*(sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092)) = -5 + 2*(sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092)).\n\nSo, for A² - B² > 0, we have:\n\n-5 + 2*(sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092)) > 0\n\n=> 2*(sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092)) > 5\n\n=> sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092) > 2.5\n\nBut as I said, sqrt(860) is sqrt(860) ≈ 29.328, sqrt(1092) ≈ 33.040.\n\nSo, 29.328 - 33.040 ≈ -3.712, which is less than 2.5. So, the left side is negative, which would make the inequality sqrt(860) - sqrt(1092) > 2.5 false.\n\nTherefore, A² - B² < 0, so A² < B², which implies A < B.\n\nWait, so that would mean that sqrt(20) + sqrt(43) is less than sqrt(26) + sqrt(42). So, sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) is larger.\n\nBut let me think again: 20, 43, 26, 42. Hmm. Maybe I can compare the two sums directly without squaring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach, such as the concavity of the square root function or some inequality like Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps I can compare the two sums sqrt(20) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) by looking at their squares. But I think I did that already.\n\nWait, but if I compute A² and B², and A² - B² is negative, so A² < B², then A < B.\n\nBut let me compute the numerical values to verify.\n\nCompute sqrt(20): sqrt(16)=4, sqrt(25)=5, so sqrt(20) is about 4.472.\n\nsqrt(43): sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(49)=7, so sqrt(43) is about 6.557.\n\nSo, sqrt(20)+sqrt(43)≈4.472 +6.557≈11.029.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(26): sqrt(25)=5, sqrt(36)=6, so sqrt(26)≈5.099.\n\nsqrt(42): sqrt(36)=6, sqrt(49)=7, so sqrt(42)≈6.480.\n\nSo, sqrt(26)+sqrt(42)≈5.099 +6.480≈11.579.\n\nSo, 11.029 vs. 11.579, so B is larger.\n\nSo, indeed, sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) is larger than sqrt(20) + sqrt(43).\n\nWait, so the initial conclusion was that A² - B² < 0, so A < B, which matches the numerical computation.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) is larger.\n\nSo, the answer is sqrt(26) + sqrt(42).\n\nBut let me just think once more.\n\nIs there another way to see this without computing the squares?\n\nMaybe, for positive numbers a, b, c, d, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) vs sqrt(c) + sqrt(d). Maybe we can compare (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))² vs (sqrt(c) + sqrt(d))².\n\nWhich is the same as comparing a + b + 2*sqrt(ab) vs c + d + 2*sqrt(cd).\n\nSo, if we can compare a + b and c + d, and also the cross terms.\n\nIn this case, a=20, b=43, c=26, d=42.\n\nSo, a + b = 63, c + d =68.\n\nSo, 63 < 68, so the sum of a and b is less than sum of c and d.\n\nBut we have 2*sqrt(ab) vs 2*sqrt(cd). Since sqrt(ab)=sqrt(860)≈29.328, and sqrt(cd)=sqrt(1092)≈33.040. So, 2*sqrt(ab)≈58.656, 2*sqrt(cd)≈66.080.\n\nSo, 58.656 < 66.080, so 2*sqrt(ab) < 2*sqrt(cd).\n\nTherefore, since both (a + b) and 2*sqrt(ab) are less than (c + d) and 2*sqrt(cd) respectively, then A² = (a + b) + 2*sqrt(ab) < (c + d) + 2*sqrt(cd) = B².\n\nTherefore, A² < B² => A < B.\n\nHence, sqrt(26) + sqrt(42) is larger.\n\nSo, I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{26} + \\sqrt{42}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{20} +"

I need to figure out which is larger between these two.\n\nSubtracting B² from A² might help:\nA² - B² = (41 - 29) + (2*sqrt(114) - 2*sqrt(204))\n= 12 + 2*(sqrt(114) - sqrt(204))\n\nHmm, this seems complicated because sqrt(204) is larger than sqrt(114). Wait, sqrt(204) is actually sqrt(4*51) which is 2*sqrt(51), and sqrt(114) is sqrt(6*19) which is not a multiple of sqrt(51). Let me compute approximate values to get a better sense.\n\nCalculating sqrt(114):\nI know that 10² = 100 and 11² = 121, so sqrt(114) is between 10 and 11. Let's see, 10.6² = 112.36, and 10.7² = 114.49. So sqrt(114) is approximately 10.68.\n\nCalculating sqrt(204):\nSimilarly, 14² = 196 and 15² = 225, so sqrt(204) is between 14 and 15. 14.2² = 201.64, and 14.3² = 204.49. So sqrt(204) is approximately 14.28.\n\nSo, sqrt(114) ≈ 10.68 and sqrt(204) ≈ 14.28.\n\nNow, let's plug these approximate values back into A² - B²:\nA² - B² ≈ 12 + 2*(10.68 - 14.28)\n= 12 + 2*(-3.6)\n= 12 - 7.2\n= 4.8\n\nSo, A² - B² is approximately 4.8, which is positive.

Let me verify my calculations because sometimes approximations can be misleading. Let me compute sqrt(114) and sqrt(204) more accurately.\n\nCalculating sqrt(114):\nWe can use the Newton-Raphson method for better precision. Let's compute sqrt(114):\n\nLet me start with an initial guess of 10.68.\n\n114 divided by 10.68 is approximately 10.68 since 10.68² = 114. So actually, 10.68² is 114. So, sqrt(114) is exactly 10.68? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 10.68² is 114, but 10.68 is just an approximation. Actually, sqrt(114) is approximately 10.68, but we can compute it more accurately.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a calculator approach here. Let me compute 10.68²:\n\n10.68 * 10.68:\n= (10 + 0.68)²\n= 10² + 2*10*0.68 + 0.68²\n= 100 + 13.6 + 0.4624\n= 114.0624\n\nHmm, so 10.68² is approximately 114.0624, which is slightly more than 114. So, sqrt(114) is slightly less than 10.68. Let's adjust.\n\nLet me try 10.67²:\n10.67 * 10.67\n= (10 + 0.67)²\n= 10² + 2*10*0.67 + 0.67²\n= 100 + 13.4 + 0.4489\n= 113.8489\n\nThat's less than 114. So sqrt(114) is between 10.67 and 10.68. Let's use linear approximation.\n\nWe have:\nAt x = 10.67, f(x) = x² = 113.8489\nAt x = 10.68, f(x) = x² = 114.0624\nWe need to find x where x² = 114.\n\nLet me compute the difference:\n114 - 113.8489 = 0.1511\nTotal interval: 114.0624 - 113.8489 = 0.2135\n\nSo, the fraction is 0.1511 / 0.2135 ≈ 0.705\n\nTherefore, sqrt(114) ≈ 10.67 + 0.705*(0.01) ≈ 10.67 + 0.00705 ≈ 10.67705\n\nSo, sqrt(114) ≈ 10.677\n\nSimilarly, let's compute sqrt(204) more accurately.\n\n204 is 4*51, so sqrt(204) = 2*sqrt(51).

Alright, let's start by understanding what exactly I'm dealing with here.\n\nFirst, all these numbers are under square roots, so they are all positive, which is good because square roots of negative numbers aren't real. So, I don't have to worry about that. Now, I need to compare two sums: one is sqrt(20) plus sqrt(43), and the other is sqrt(30) plus sqrt(42). My goal is to see which of these two sums is larger.\n\nI remember that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes it's helpful to square both sides to make them more manageable. But before I jump into squaring, maybe I can approximate the values to get a sense of which sum might be larger. Let me do that first.\n\nLet's approximate sqrt(20) and sqrt(43). sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(20) should be somewhere between 4 and 5. Let me calculate it more precisely. 4.4 squared is 19.36, which is just a bit less than 20. 4.5 squared is 20.25, which is just a bit more than 20. So, sqrt(20) is approximately 4.472.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(43): sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(43) is between 6 and 7.

So, sqrt(43) is approximately 6.557.\n\nSo, if I add sqrt(20) and sqrt(43), that's about 4.472 + 6.557, which is approximately 11.029.\n\nNow, let's approximate sqrt(30) and sqrt(42). sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(30) is between 5 and 6. Let's calculate 5.5 squared: 30.25, which is just a bit more than 30. So, sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(42): sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(42) is between 6 and 7. Let's calculate 6.5 squared: 42.25, which is just a bit more than 42. So, sqrt(42) is approximately 6.480.\n\nAdding sqrt(30) and sqrt(42), that's about 5.477 + 6.480, which is approximately 11.957.\n\nWait a second, so based on these approximations, sqrt(30) + sqrt(42) is approximately 11.957, while sqrt(20) + sqrt(43) is approximately 11.029. So, that would suggest that sqrt(30) + sqrt(42) is larger.\n\nBut, of course, these are just approximations. The actual values could be a little different. Maybe I should try squaring both sums to see which one is larger without relying on approximations, but that might be a bit more work.\n\nLet me try squaring sqrt(20) + sqrt(43). So, (sqrt(20) + sqrt(43))² = (sqrt(20))² + 2*sqrt(20)*sqrt(43) + (sqrt(43))² = 20 + 43 + 2*sqrt(20*43) = 63 + 2*sqrt(860).\n\nSimilarly, squaring sqrt(30) + sqrt(42): (sqrt(30) + sqrt(42))² = 30 + 42 + 2*sqrt(30*42) = 72 + 2*sqrt(1260).\n\nNow, so I have sqrt(20) + sqrt(43) squared is 63 + 2*sqrt(860), and sqrt(30) + sqrt(42) squared is 72 + 2*sqrt(1260).\n\nTo compare these, let's subtract 63 from both to make it easier: 2*sqrt(860) versus 72 + 2*sqrt(1260) - 63, which is 2*sqrt(1260) + 9.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, maybe I should compute both squared values numerically and then compare.\n\nLet me compute 2*sqrt(860). sqrt(860): sqrt(841 is 29, so 29^2 is 841, 29.5^2 is (29 + 0.5)^2 = 29^2 + 2*29*0.5 + 0.25 = 841 + 29 + 0.25 = 870.25, which is more than 860. So, sqrt(860) is between 29 and 29.5. Let me calculate 29.5^2 is 870.25, so 29.5^2 is 870.25. So, 860 is 870.25 - 10.25, so sqrt(860) is 29.5 - (10.25)/(2*29.5) by linear approximation. So, 10.25/(59) is approximately 0.173. So, sqrt(860) ≈ 29.5 - 0.173 = 29.327.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(860) ≈ 58.654.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1260): sqrt(1225 is 35, 35.5^2 is 1260.25. So, 35.5^2 is 1260.25, so sqrt(1260) is just a bit less than 35.5. Let me compute 35.5^2 is 1260.25, so 35.5^2 - 1260 is 0.25, so sqrt(1260) ≈ 35.5 - (0.25)/(2*35.5) ≈ 35.5 - 0.0035 ≈ 35.4965.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(1260) ≈ 70.993.\n\nTherefore, going back:\n\nFor sqrt(20) + sqrt(43) squared: 63 + 58.654 ≈ 121.654.\n\nFor sqrt(30) + sqrt(42) squared: 72 + 70.993 ≈ 142.993.\n\nSince 142.993 is much larger than 121.654, that means that sqrt(30) + sqrt(42) squared is larger than sqrt(20) + sqrt(43) squared. Therefore, sqrt(30) + sqrt(42) is larger than sqrt(20) + sqrt(43).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I approximated sqrt(860) as 29.327, but let me check that again because I remember that 29.327 squared is approximately 860. So, 29.327^2: 29^2 is 841, 0.327^2 is about 0.107, and cross terms: 2*29*0.327 is about 18.574. So total is 841 + 18.574 + 0.107 ≈ 860. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1260): 35.4965 squared is approximately (35 + 0.4965)^2 = 35^2 + 2*35*0.4965 + 0.4965^2 = 1225 + 34.73 + 0.246 ≈ 1260.0. So that seems correct as well.\n\nTherefore, the squares are 121.654 and"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(7) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(23) + sqrt(28) or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare? That sounds like a solid plan.\n\nLet me denote A as sqrt(7) + sqrt(39) and B as sqrt(23) + sqrt(28). So, A = sqrt(7) + sqrt(39) and B = sqrt(23) + sqrt(28). I need to find out if A is greater than B or not.\n\nTo compare A and B, I can square both A and B and then compare the results. Squaring A gives me A² = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(39))². Let me compute that.\n\nUsing the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so substituting:\n\nA² = (sqrt(7))² + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(39) + (sqrt(39))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(7))² = 7\n\nSimilarly, (sqrt(39))² = 39\n\nNow, the middle term is 2*sqrt(7*39). Let me compute 7*39 first. 7*40 is 280, so 7*39 is 280 - 7 = 273. So, 2*sqrt(273). Hmm, sqrt(273) is approximately... Well, sqrt(289) is 17, so sqrt(273) is a bit less, maybe around 16.5? Not sure, but I can leave it as sqrt(273) for now.\n\nSo, A² = 7 + 2*sqrt(273) + 39. Adding 7 and 39 gives 46. So A² = 46 + 2*sqrt(273).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute B². B = sqrt(23) + sqrt(28), so squaring it:\n\nB² = (sqrt(23) + sqrt(28))²\n\nAgain, using the same formula:\n\nB² = (sqrt(23))² + 2*sqrt(23)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(23))² = 23\n\n(sqrt(28))² = 28\n\nAnd the middle term is 2*sqrt(23*28). Let me compute 23*28. 20*28 is 560, and 3*28 is 84, so 560 + 84 = 644. So, 2*sqrt(644). Hmm, sqrt(644) is approximately... Well, sqrt(625) is 25, sqrt(676) is 26, so sqrt(644) is between 25 and 26. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\n644 divided by 25 is 25.76. 25.76 squared is approximately 664. Hmm, wait, that's not helpful. Maybe I can factor 644 to see if it's a perfect square or can be simplified.\n\n644 divided by 2 is 322, divided by 2 again is 161. 161 is 7*23. So, 644 is 4*161, which is 4*7*23. So, sqrt(644) = sqrt(4*7*23) = 2*sqrt(161). Hmm, 161 is 7*23, neither of which are perfect squares. So, sqrt(644) is 2*sqrt(161).\n\nSo, B² = 23 + 2*sqrt(161) + 28. Adding 23 and 28 gives 51. So, B² = 51 + 2*sqrt(161).\n\nNow, we have A² = 46 + 2*sqrt(273) and B² = 51 + 2*sqrt(161). To compare A and B, we can compare A² and B².\n\nSo, subtract B² from A²:\n\nA² - B² = (46 + 2*sqrt(273)) - (51 + 2*sqrt(161)) = 46 - 51 + 2*sqrt(273) - 2*sqrt(161) = -5 + 2*(sqrt(273) - sqrt(161)).\n\nSo, A² - B² = -5 + 2*(sqrt(273) - sqrt(161)).\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(273) and sqrt(161) numerically to see what this difference is.\n\nFirst, sqrt(273). Well, 16² = 256 and 17² = 289, so sqrt(273) is between 16 and 17. Let's approximate it. 16.5² = 272.25, which is very close to 273. So, sqrt(273) ≈ 16.5006.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(161). 12² = 144, 13² = 169. So, sqrt(161) is between 12 and 13. Let's approximate it. 12.7² = 161.29, which is just above 161. So, sqrt(161) ≈ 12.69.\n\nSo, sqrt(273) - sqrt(161) ≈ 16.5006 - 12.69 ≈ 3.8106.\n\nSo, 2*(sqrt(273) - sqrt(161)) ≈ 2*3.8106 ≈ 7.6212.\n\nTherefore, A² - B² ≈ -5 + 7.6212 ≈ 2.6212.\n\nSince A² - B² is positive (≈2.6212), that means A² > B², so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(7) + sqrt(39) is greater than sqrt(23) + sqrt(28).\n\nBut wait, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, computing A²:\n\n(sqrt(7) + sqrt(39))² = 7 + 2*sqrt(273) + 39 = 46 + 2*sqrt(273). That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, B²:\n\n(sqrt(23) + sqrt(28))² = 23 + 2*sqrt(644) + 28 = 51 + 2*sqrt(644). Wait, 644 is 4*161, so sqrt(644) is 2*sqrt(161). So, 2*sqrt(644) is 4*sqrt(161). Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me correct that. When I squared B, I had 2*sqrt(23*28). 23*28 is 644, which is 4*161, so sqrt(644) is 2*sqrt(161). Therefore, 2*sqrt(644) is 2*(2*sqrt(161)) = 4*sqrt(161). So, B² = 23 + 4*sqrt(161) + 28 = 51 + 4*sqrt(161). Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let's clarify:\n\nWhen I compute B², it's (sqrt(23) + sqrt(28))², which is 23 + 2*sqrt(23*28) + 28. So, 23 + 28 is 51. The middle term is 2*sqrt(23*28). 23*28 is 644, as I had before, which is 4*161. So, sqrt(644) is 2*sqrt(161). Therefore, the middle term is 2*(2*sqrt(161)) = 4*sqrt(161).\n\nSo, B² is 51 + 4*sqrt(161). Wait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, in my initial step, I had:\n\nB² = 23 + 2*sqrt(161) + 28, which is 51 + 2*sqrt(161). But that's incorrect because the middle term is 2"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(15) + sqrt(35) and sqrt(27) + sqrt(29). The goal is to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't behave linearly like regular numbers. For example, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) isn't necessarily equal to sqrt(a + b), so I can't just add the numbers under the roots directly. That means I'll have to find a different way to compare these two sums.\n\nMaybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare? Squaring might help because square functions are monotonic for non-negative numbers, so the larger square will correspond to the larger original number. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(15) + sqrt(35) and B = sqrt(27) + sqrt(29). If I square A and B, I can compare the results:\n\nA² = (sqrt(15) + sqrt(35))² = 15 + 2*sqrt(15*35) + 35 = 50 + 2*sqrt(525)\nB² = (sqrt(27) + sqrt(29))² = 27 + 2*sqrt(27*29) + 29 = 56 + 2*sqrt(783)\n\nHmm, so now I have A² = 50 + 2*sqrt(525) and B² = 56 + 2*sqrt(783). I need to figure out which is larger between these two.\n\nFirst, let's compute sqrt(525) and sqrt(783). I can approximate these to see which one is bigger.\n\nCalculating sqrt(525):\n525 is between 529 (which is 23^2) and 524. Let me see, 22^2 is 484, 23^2 is 529. So sqrt(525) is just a bit less than 23. Maybe approximately 22.93 or something. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, no. Wait, 22^2=484, 23^2=529, so 525 is 4 more than 521, which is 22.82^2, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that 525 = 25*21, so sqrt(525) = 5*sqrt(21). Similarly, sqrt(783) = sqrt(9*87) = 3*sqrt(87).\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach in my mind: 23^2=529, so sqrt(525) is 23 - (529 - 525)/(2*23) approximately. Using linear approximation.\n\nSo, sqrt(525) ≈ 23 - (4)/(46) = 23 - 0.087 ≈ 22.913.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(783): Since 28^2=784, which is just 1 more than 783, so sqrt(783) is approximately 28 - (1)/(2*28) ≈ 28 - 0.0179 ≈ 27.982.\n\nSo, sqrt(525) ≈22.913 and sqrt(783)≈27.982.\n\nNow, plug these back into A² and B²:\n\nA² ≈50 + 2*22.913 ≈50 + 45.826≈95.826\n\nB²≈56 + 2*27.982≈56 +55.964≈111.964\n\nSo, A²≈95.826 and B²≈111.964, which means B² > A². Since the square function is increasing for non-negative numbers, this implies that B > A.\n\nTherefore, B = sqrt(27) + sqrt(29) is larger than A = sqrt(15) + sqrt(35). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(27) + sqrt(29).\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check my approximations for sqrt(525) and sqrt(783):\n\nFor sqrt(525): 23^2=529, so 525 is 4 less, so sqrt(525) is 23 - 4/(2*23) = 23 - 2/23 ≈23 -0.087≈22.913. That's correct.\n\nFor sqrt(783): 28^2=784, so 783 is 1 less, so sqrt(783) is 28 - 1/(2*28)=28 -1/56≈28 -0.017857≈27.982143. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, A²≈50 + 2*22.913≈50 +45.826≈95.826\n\nB²≈56 + 2*27.982143≈56 +55.964286≈111.964286\n\nHence, B² is indeed larger than A², so B is larger than A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try another method to compare them without squaring?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe I can pair terms or use some inequality.\n\nWait, I could also try to compute the difference between B and A, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can approximate the values of A and B.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(15) + sqrt(35):\n\nsqrt(15)≈3.87298, sqrt(35)≈5.91608. So A≈3.87298 +5.91608≈9.78906\n\nCompute B = sqrt(27) + sqrt(29):\n\nsqrt(27)≈5.19615, sqrt(29)≈5.38516. So B≈5.19615 +5.38516≈10.58131\n\nTherefore, numerically, A≈9.789 and B≈10.581, so B is larger, which matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, just to recap:\n\nBy squaring both expressions, I found that B² is about 111.96 and A² is about 95.826, so B > A. Also, by approximating the square roots and adding them numerically, I got the same conclusion. So, both methods support that B is larger.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(27) + sqrt(29), which is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, the answer is sqrt(27) + sqrt(29), and we can write that in the required format.\n\nWait, just to make sure, is there another way someone might approach this? Maybe by comparing the terms before squaring?\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could try to compare sqrt(15) + sqrt(35) vs sqrt(27) + sqrt(29) by some inequality, but I don't think a straightforward inequality applies here. Squaring both is a standard method when dealing with sums of square roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could consider the difference between the two sums: B - A = (sqrt(27) + sqrt(29)) - (sqrt(15) + sqrt(35)). If this difference is positive, then B > A.\n\nBut computing this exact difference might be complicated without a calculator, so squaring seems more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, another thought: Maybe compare sqrt(15) and sqrt(27), and sqrt(35) and sqrt(29), but that might not directly help because adding them doesn't translate to adding their individual comparisons.\n\nFor example, sqrt(15)≈3.87 and sqrt(27)≈5.19, so sqrt(27) > sqrt(15). Similarly, sqrt(35)≈5.91 and sqrt(29)≈5.39, so sqrt(35) > sqrt(29). So, individually, one term is larger and the other is smaller. So, adding them doesn't straightforwardly tell us which total is larger.\n\nHence, the better approach is to square both sums, as we did before, to get a clear comparison.\n\nSo, to make sure, let me recompute the squares:\n\nA² = (sqrt(15) + sqrt(35))² = 15 + 35 + 2*sqrt(15*35)"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this math problem to solve: I need to compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) and sqrt(25) + sqrt(33). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(25) is a perfect square, so sqrt(25) is just 5. That should make things a bit simpler. So, the expression sqrt(25) + sqrt(33) simplifies to 5 + sqrt(33). So, now I have two expressions to compare: sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) and 5 + sqrt(33). \n\nHmm, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) is bigger or smaller than 5 + sqrt(33). Maybe I can compute both expressions numerically? That might be a straightforward way. Let's try that.\n\nCalculating sqrt(8): I know that sqrt(9) is 3, so sqrt(8) must be a little less than 3. Let me see, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(5) is about 2.236, sqrt(6) is about 2.449, sqrt(7) is about 2.645, and sqrt(8) is approximately 2.828. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nCalculating sqrt(37): Hmm, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(37) should be a bit more than 6. Let me compute it. 6.0 squared is 36, 6.1 squared is 37.21, so sqrt(37) is approximately 6.082. Wait, let me verify that: 6.082 squared is approximately 6.082*6.082. Let me compute 6*6=36, 6*0.082=0.492, 0.082*6=0.492, and 0.082*0.082≈0.0067. Adding those up: 36 + 0.492 + 0.492 + 0.0067≈36 + 0.984 + 0.0067≈37.0. So, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.082.\n\nNow, sqrt(33): sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(33) is somewhere in between. Let me compute 5.7 squared: 5.7*5.7=32.49, which is less than 33. 5.8 squared is 33.64, which is more than 33. So, sqrt(33) is between 5.7 and 5.8. Let's approximate it: 5.7^2=32.49, 5.75^2=33.0625, which is just a bit over 33. So, sqrt(33) is about 5.744. Wait, let me check: 5.74^2 = ?\n\nCalculating 5.74 * 5.74: 5*5=25, 5*0.74=3.7, 0.74*5=3.7, 0.74*0.74≈0.5476. Adding those up: 25 + 3.7 + 3.7 + 0.5476≈25 + 7.4 + 0.5476≈32.9476. Close to 33.

So, 10.744 is larger than 8.910. So, sqrt(25) + sqrt(33) is approximately 10.744, which is larger than sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) which is approximately 8.910.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations because 8.910 vs. 10.744 seems like a big difference. Maybe I made a mistake in approximating the square roots?\n\nLet me recalculate sqrt(8): sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(9)=3, so sqrt(8) is 2.828, correct?\n\nsqrt(37): 6.082, let's see, 6.082*6.082. Let me compute 6*6=36, 6*0.082=0.492, 0.082*6=0.492, 0.082*0.082≈0.0067. So, adding them: 36 + 0.492 + 0.492 + 0.0067≈36 + 0.984 + 0.0067≈37.0. So, that seems accurate.\n\nsqrt(33): sqrt(25)=5, sqrt(36)=6, so sqrt(33) is between 5.7 and 5.8. Let me compute 5.744^2.\n\nWait, 5.744*5.744. Let me do this step by step:\n\nFirst, 5*5=25\n\n5*0.744=3.72\n\n0.744*5=3.72\n\n0.744*0.744≈0.5535\n\nSo, adding them up: 25 + 3.72 + 3.72 + 0.5535≈25 + 7.44 + 0.5535≈32.9935\n\nWait, that's approximately 32.9935, which is just slightly less than 33. So, sqrt(33) is approximately 5.744, correct.\n\nSo, sqrt(33) is 5.744, sqrt(8) is 2.828, sqrt(37) is 6.082.\n\nNow, sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) ≈2.828 + 6.082≈8.910\n\nsqrt(25) + sqrt(33)≈5 + 5.744≈10.744\n\nSo, yes, 10.744 is larger than 8.910. So, sqrt(25) + sqrt(33) is larger.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a mathematical way to compare these sums without approximating? Maybe by squaring both expressions?\n\nLet me square both sides. Let me denote A = sqrt(8) + sqrt(37), and B = sqrt(25) + sqrt(33). So, I need to compare A and B.\n\nIf A > B, then A^2 > B^2. But let's compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(37))^2 = 8 + 2*sqrt(8*37) + 37 = 45 + 2*sqrt(296)\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(25) + sqrt(33))^2 = 25 + 2*sqrt(25*33) + 33 = 58 + 2*sqrt(825)\n\nSo, now we have A^2 = 45 + 2*sqrt(296), and B^2 = 58 + 2*sqrt(825).\n\nSo, we can compare 45 + 2*sqrt(296) vs. 58 + 2*sqrt(825).\n\nSubtract 45 from both sides: 2*sqrt(296) vs. 13 + 2*sqrt(825).\n\nWait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, subtract 45 from both sides:\n\nA^2 - B^2 = (45 + 2*sqrt(296)) - (58 + 2*sqrt(825)) = -13 + 2*(sqrt(296) - sqrt(825))\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 = -13 + 2*(sqrt(296) - sqrt(8"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(5) + sqrt(28) and sqrt(13) + sqrt(24), and figure out which one is larger. Hmm, interesting. I remember that when comparing square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help eliminate the square roots, making it easier to compare. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let me denote A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(28) and B = sqrt(13) + sqrt(24). I need to find out whether A is greater than B or vice versa. To do this, I can square both A and B and then compare the results. \n\nLet me compute A squared first:\nA² = (sqrt(5) + sqrt(28))²\nUsing the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so:\nA² = (sqrt(5))² + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))²\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(5))² = 5\n(sqrt(28))² = 28\n2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(28) = 2*sqrt(5*28) = 2*sqrt(140). Hmm, sqrt(140) is equal to sqrt(4*35) which is 2*sqrt(35). So, 2*sqrt(140) becomes 2*(2*sqrt(35)) = 4*sqrt(35). \n\nPutting it all together:\nA² = 5 + 4*sqrt(35) + 28\nSimplify:\n5 + 28 = 33, so A² = 33 + 4*sqrt(35)\n\nNow let's compute B squared:\nB² = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(24))²\nAgain, using the same formula:\nB² = (sqrt(13))² + 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(24) + (sqrt(24))²\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(13))² = 13\n(sqrt(24))² = 24\n2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(13*24) = 2*sqrt(312). Hmm, sqrt(312) can be simplified. Let's see, 312 divided by 4 is 78, so sqrt(312) = sqrt(4*78) = 2*sqrt(78). Therefore, 2*sqrt(312) becomes 2*(2*sqrt(78)) = 4*sqrt(78).\n\nPutting it all together:\nB² = 13 + 4*sqrt(78) + 24\nSimplify:\n13 + 24 = 37, so B² = 37 + 4*sqrt(78)\n\nNow, I have A² = 33 + 4*sqrt(35) and B² = 37 + 4*sqrt(78). I need to compare A² and B².\n\nFirst, let's subtract A² from B² to see if B² is larger:\nB² - A² = (37 + 4*sqrt(78)) - (33 + 4*sqrt(35))\nSimplify:\n37 - 33 = 4, so B² - A² = 4 + 4*sqrt(78) - 4*sqrt(35)\n\nHmm, so it's 4 + 4*(sqrt(78) - sqrt(35)). Since sqrt(78) is approximately equal to 8.83 and sqrt(35) is approximately 5.92, their difference is about 2.91. So, 4*(2.91) is approximately 11.64. Adding 4 to that gives about 15.64.\n\nSo, B² - A² is approximately 15.64, which is positive. That means B² > A², which implies that B > A.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit large. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying sqrt(312) and sqrt(140). Let me go through them again.\n\nStarting with A²:\nsqrt(5)² is 5, sqrt(28)² is 28, and 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(28) is indeed 2*sqrt(140). sqrt(140) can be simplified as sqrt(4*35) which is 2*sqrt(35). So, 2*2*sqrt(35) is 4*sqrt(35). That part seems right.\n\nSo, A² is 5 + 28 + 4*sqrt(35) = 33 + 4*sqrt(35). That looks correct.\n\nNow, B²:\nsqrt(13)² is 13, sqrt(24)² is 24, and 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(24) is 2*sqrt(312). 312 divided by 4 is 78, so sqrt(312) is 2*sqrt(78). Therefore, 2*2*sqrt(78) is 4*sqrt(78). That also seems correct.\n\nSo, B² is 13 + 24 + 4*sqrt(78) = 37 + 4*sqrt(78). Correct.\n\nSo, B² - A² is 37 + 4*sqrt(78) - 33 - 4*sqrt(35) = 4 + 4*(sqrt(78) - sqrt(35)).\n\nAs I calculated earlier, sqrt(78) is about 8.83 and sqrt(35) is about 5.92, so their difference is about 2.91. Multiply by 4 gives approximately 11.64, add 4 gives approximately 15.64. So, B² - A² is about 15.64, which is positive, meaning B² is larger than A², so B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(13) + sqrt(24) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(28). So, the larger number is sqrt(13) + sqrt(24). Hence, I should write that in the box.\n\nWait a second, let me see if there's another way to compare them without squaring, just to cross-verify. Maybe comparing the individual terms. Let me see.\n\nsqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, sqrt(28) is approximately 5.291, so A is roughly 2.236 + 5.291 = 7.527.\n\nsqrt(13) is approximately 3.606, sqrt(24) is approximately 4.899, so B is roughly 3.606 + 4.899 = 8.505.\n\nSo, numerically, B is larger than A. That's consistent with the earlier result. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare sqrt(5) + sqrt(28) and sqrt(13) + sqrt(24) by estimating each term. But since I have approximate values, it's a bit rough, but gives the same result.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Maybe rationalizing the expressions or seeing if they can be expressed as some kind of perfect squares or similar.\n\nWait, let me think. sqrt(5) is not a perfect square, sqrt(28) is 2*sqrt(7), sqrt(13) is not a perfect square, sqrt(24) is 2*sqrt(6). So, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe comparing sqrt(13) + sqrt(24) with sqrt(5) + sqrt(28) by considering their approximate decimal values.\n\nWait, I already did that. sqrt(5) + sqrt(28) is approximately 7.527, and sqrt(13) + sqrt(24) is approximately 8.505, so B is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of exponents or something else, but I think squaring was a good approach.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I did the squaring correctly. A² is (sqrt(5) + sqrt(28))², which is 5 + 28 + 2*sqrt(5*28) = 33 + 2*sqrt(140). Then sqrt(140) is 2*sqrt(35), so 2*sqrt(140) is 4*sqrt(35). So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, B² is (sqrt(13) + sqrt(24))², which is 13 + 24 + 2*sqrt(13*24) = 37 + 2*sqrt(312). Then sqrt(312) is sqrt(4*78) = 2*sqrt(78), so 2*"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(32) + sqrt(46) and sqrt(36) + sqrt(43). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(32) is approximately 5.656, and sqrt(46) is about 6.782. Adding those together gives me roughly 5.656 + 6.782, which is approximately 12.438. On the other side, sqrt(36) is exactly 6, and sqrt(43) is approximately 6.557. Adding those gives me 6 + 6.557, which is about 12.557. So, comparing these two, 12.557 is larger than 12.438. So, sqrt(36) + sqrt(43) is larger.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I should calculate more precise values instead of approximating? Let me try that.\n\nCalculating sqrt(32): 5^2 is 25, 6^2 is 36. 32 is closer to 36, so sqrt(32) should be just a bit less than 6. Let me use linear approximation. The derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2sqrt(x)). At x=36, the derivative is 1/(2*6) = 1/12. So, the linear approximation around x=36 would be sqrt(36 + h) ≈ sqrt(36) + h/(2sqrt(36)). Here, h = 32 - 36 = -4, but that's not helpful. Maybe I should do a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate sqrt(32). Starting with an initial guess of 5.6 (since 5.6^2 = 31.36). Let's compute 5.6^2: 5.6*5.6 = 31.36. The difference is 32 - 31.36 = 0.64. The next approximation is 5.6 - 0.64/(2*5.6) = 5.6 - 0.64/11.2 ≈ 5.6 - 0.0571 ≈ 5.5429. Let's square that: 5.5429^2. 5^2 = 25, 0.5429^2 ≈ 0.294, and cross term 2*5*0.5429≈5.429. So total is 25 + 5.429 + 0.294 ≈ 30.723? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 5.5429^2 is actually approximately 30.723, which is less than 32. Hmm, maybe I messed up the computation.\n\nWait, no, actually, 5.5^2 is 30.25, 5.6^2 is 31.36, 5.7^2 is 32.49. Since 32 is between 31.36 and 32.49, sqrt(32) is between 5.6 and 5.7. Let's use linear approximation again.\n\nThe derivative at x=31.36 is 1/(2*5.6)≈0.089286. So, sqrt(32) ≈ sqrt(31.36) + (32 - 31.36)*0.089286 ≈ 5.6 + 0.64*0.089286 ≈ 5.6 + 0.057 ≈ 5.657. That seems better.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(46). Let's do the same. 6^2 is 36, 7^2 is 49. 46 is 10 away from 36, so sqrt(46) is between 6 and 7. Let's use linear approximation around x=36.\n\nDerivative at x=36 is 1/(2*6)=1/12≈0.083333.\n\nSo, sqrt(46) ≈ sqrt(36) + (46 - 36)*0.083333 ≈ 6 + 10*0.083333≈6 + 0.8333≈6.8333.\n\nNow, let's square 6.8333 to check: 6^2=36, 0.8333^2≈0.6944, cross term 2*6*0.8333≈10. So total is 36 + 10 + 0.6944≈46.6944. Wait, that's more than 46, so maybe my linear approximation isn't precise enough. Alternatively, I can use a better approximation method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Newton-Raphson method for sqrt(32) and sqrt(46). Let's try that.\n\nFor sqrt(32):\n\nLet f(x) = x^2 - 32.

Let's compute 5.6571^2:\n\n5^2=25, 0.6571^2≈0.4316, cross term 2*5*0.6571≈6.571.\n\nSo total is 25 + 6.571 + 0.4316≈32.0026. Wow, that's very close to 32. So f(x1)=32.0026 -32≈0.0026.\n\nCompute f'(x1)=2*5.6571≈11.3142.\n\nNext iteration: x2 = x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1)=5.6571 - 0.0026/11.3142≈5.6571 -0.00023≈5.65687.\n\nCompute f(x2)=5.65687^2 -32.

Let me start by calculating each value separately to see which one is bigger.\n\nFirst, sqrt(1) is easy because the square root of 1 is just 1. So that part is straightforward. Now, sqrt(30)... Hmm, I know that sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(30) should be somewhere between 5 and 6. Let me approximate it. 30 is 1/6 less than 36, so maybe sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477. Let me double-check that with a calculator. 5.477 squared is approximately 30, so that seems right. So sqrt(30) ≈ 5.477.\n\nNow, moving on to sqrt(17). I know that sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(17) should be between 4 and 5. Let me approximate it. 17 is 1/9 less than 18, but I think a better approximation would be to consider the difference between 16 and 25. Wait, actually, to calculate sqrt(17), I can use the linear approximation around sqrt(16). The derivative of sqrt(x) at x=16 is (1)/(2*sqrt(16)) = 1/8. So, using linear approximation, sqrt(17) ≈ sqrt(16) + (17 - 16)*(1/8) = 4 + 1/8 = 4.125. Is that correct? Let me check with a calculator. 4.123 squared is approximately 17, so yeah, sqrt(17) ≈ 4.123.\n\nOkay, so now I have the approximate values:\n- sqrt(1) + sqrt(30) ≈ 1 + 5.477 ≈ 6.477\n- sqrt(17) + sqrt(25) ≈ 4.123 + 5 ≈ 9.123\n\nComparing these two, 6.477 is less than 9.123.

So, let me see.\n\nCompute B² - A²: (42 + 2*sqrt(425)) - (31 + 2*sqrt(30)) = 11 + 2*(sqrt(425) - sqrt(30))\n\nSo, if 11 + 2*(sqrt(425) - sqrt(30)) is positive, then B² > A², meaning B > A.\n\nSo, I need to check if 2*(sqrt(425) - sqrt(30)) is greater than -11, which it obviously is because sqrt(425) is much larger than sqrt(30).\n\nBut wait, let's compute sqrt(425) and sqrt(30) numerically to get a better idea.\n\nsqrt(30) ≈ 5.477 as before.\n\nsqrt(425)... Hmm, 20² is 400, so sqrt(425) is a bit more than 20. Let me compute 20² = 400, so 20*20 + 25 = 20² + 5², but wait, that's for Pythagorean triples, but maybe that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(425) = sqrt(25*17) = 5*sqrt(17). Wait, that's interesting because sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123. So, sqrt(425) = 5*sqrt(17) ≈ 5*4.123 ≈ 20.615.\n\nSo, sqrt(425) ≈ 20.615. So, sqrt(425) - sqrt(30) ≈ 20.615 - 5.477 ≈ 15.138.\n\nTherefore, 2*(sqrt(425) - sqrt(30)) ≈ 2*15.138 ≈ 30.276.\n\nThen, B² - A² ≈ 11 + 30.276 ≈ 41.276, which is definitely positive.

Is there a way to compare sqrt(17) + sqrt(25) and sqrt(1) + sqrt(30) without squaring?\n\nMaybe using the triangle inequality or something else. Let me recall that for positive numbers, (a + b)² ≤ (c + d)² if the products ab ≤ cd. Wait, that might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compare the differences.

So, it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, consider that sqrt(17) + sqrt(25) can be compared to sqrt(1) + sqrt(30) by seeing how much each term contributes.\n\nBut wait, sqrt(17) is more than sqrt(16)=4, which is 4, and sqrt(25)=5, so 4 + 5 =9.\n\nWhereas sqrt(1) is 1 and sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477, so 1 + 5.477 ≈ 6.477.\n\nSo, the 4 + 5 =9 is definitely larger than 1 + 5.477.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(17) + sqrt(25) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the differences.\n\nLet me compute B - A: sqrt(17) - sqrt(1) + sqrt(25) - sqrt(30) = (sqrt(17) - sqrt(1)) + (sqrt(25) - sqrt(30)).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nsqrt(17) - sqrt(1) ≈ 4.123 - 1 = 3.123\n\nsqrt(25) - sqrt(30) ≈ 5 - 5.477 ≈ -0.477\n\nSo, total B - A ≈ 3.123 - 0.477 ≈ 2.646\n\nWhich is positive.

This simplifies to 14 + 2*sqrt(630) + 45. So, B² = 59 + 2*sqrt(630).\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B². That is, 56 + 2*sqrt(460) vs. 59 + 2*sqrt(630). Let me subtract 56 from both sides to make it simpler: 2*sqrt(460) vs. 3 + 2*sqrt(630). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I should compute the numerical values of both A² and B².\n\nFirst, let's calculate sqrt(460). sqrt(460) is sqrt(4*115) = 2*sqrt(115). Similarly, sqrt(630) is sqrt(9*70) = 3*sqrt(70). Let me approximate these square roots.\n\nStarting with sqrt(115): 10² = 100, 11² = 121, so sqrt(115) is between 10 and 11. Let's estimate it. 10.7² = 114.49, which is just below 115. 10.7² = 114.49, so sqrt(115) ≈ 10.7236.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(460) = 2*10.7236 ≈ 21.4472.\n\nSo, A² = 56 + 2*21.4472 ≈ 56 + 42.8944 ≈ 98.8944.\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(70). 8² = 64, 9² = 81, so sqrt(70) is between 8 and 9. 8.3² = 68.89, 8.4² = 70.56. So sqrt(70) ≈ 8.3666.\n\nThus, sqrt(630) = 3*8.3666 ≈ 25.0998.\n\nTherefore, B² = 59 + 2*25.0998 ≈ 59 + 50.1996 ≈ 109.1996.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 98.8944 and B² ≈ 109.1996. Since A² < B², that means A < B.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit counterintuitive because sqrt(14) is smaller than sqrt(10)? Wait, no, sqrt(14) is about 3.7417, while sqrt(10) is about 3.1623, so sqrt(14) is actually larger than sqrt(10). So, while sqrt(14) is larger than sqrt(10), sqrt(45) is sqrt(45) ≈ 6.7082, and sqrt(46) is sqrt(46) ≈ 6.7823. So, the second term in B is actually slightly smaller than the second term in A, but the first term is a bit larger. So, overall, B might be larger than A.\n\nBut when I squared both, A² was about 98.89 and B² was about 109.20, so actually B² is larger, meaning B is larger than A. So, my initial thought that sqrt(14) is larger than sqrt(10) is correct, but the sqrt(45) is slightly larger than sqrt(46), which brings down the overall value.\n\nTherefore, B = sqrt(14) + sqrt(45) is larger than A = sqrt(10) + sqrt(46).\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should compute the decimal values of A and B to confirm.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(10) + sqrt(46). sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623, sqrt(46) ≈ 6.7823. So, A ≈ 3.1623 + 6.7823 ≈ 9.9446.\n\nCompute B = sqrt(14) + sqrt(45). sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417, sqrt(45) ≈ 6.7082. So, B ≈ 3.7417 + 6.7082 ≈ 10.4499.\n\nSo, indeed, B is approximately 10.45, which is larger than A's approximately 9.94. So, B is larger.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(14) + sqrt(45), which can be written as sqrt(14) + sqrt(45).\n\nWait, let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, A² = (sqrt(10) + sqrt(46))² = 10 + 46 + 2*sqrt(10*46) = 56 + 2*sqrt(460). 460 is 4*115, so sqrt(460) is 2*sqrt(115). Then, sqrt(115) ≈ 10.7236, so sqrt(460) ≈ 21.4472. Then, 2*21.4472 is 42.8944, so 56 + 42.8944 ≈ 98.8944. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, B² = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(45))² = 14 + 45 + 2*sqrt(14*45) = 59 + 2*sqrt(630). 630 is 9*70, so sqrt(630) is 3*sqrt(70). sqrt(70) ≈ 8.3666, so sqrt(630) ≈ 25.0998. 2*25.0998 ≈ 50.1996, so 59 + 50.1996 ≈ 109.1996. Correct.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 98.8944 and B² ≈ 109.1996. Therefore, B² is larger, meaning B is larger than A.\n\nAlternatively, another method: perhaps I can compare the two sums without squaring. But squaring seems to have worked here, and the decimal approximations confirm it.\n\nBut just for thoroughness, let me think about another approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the difference B - A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(45) - sqrt(10) - sqrt(46). If I can show that this difference is positive, then B is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can group the terms differently. For example, (sqrt(14) - sqrt(10)) + (sqrt(45) - sqrt(46)). Maybe I can estimate each difference.\n\nCompute sqrt(14) - sqrt(10): sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417, sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623. So, 3.7417 - 3.1623 ≈ 0.5794.\n\nCompute sqrt(45) - sqrt(46): sqrt(45) ≈ "

I remember that sometimes comparing square roots can be tricky because they don't play along with the same rules as regular multiplication or addition. But maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare.\n\nLet me write down both expressions:\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(1) + sqrt(47)\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(11) + sqrt(30)\n\nI want to compare which one is larger, so maybe I can square both and see which one is bigger. But before I do that, let me note that squaring a sum of square roots isn't straightforward. The formula is (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))² = a + b + 2*sqrt(ab). So, if I square both expressions, I can get some information about which one is larger.\n\nLet me compute the squares:\n\nFirst expression squared: [sqrt(1) + sqrt(47)]² = 1 + 47 + 2*sqrt(1*47) = 48 + 2*sqrt(47)\n\nSecond expression squared: [sqrt(11) + sqrt(30)]² = 11 + 30 + 2*sqrt(11*30) = 41 + 2*sqrt(330)\n\nNow, I need to compare 48 + 2*sqrt(47) and 41 + 2*sqrt(330). Let me see the difference between them:\n\n(48 + 2*sqrt(47)) - (41 + 2*sqrt(330)) = 7 + 2*sqrt(47) - 2*sqrt(330)\n\nHmm, so if 7 + 2*sqrt(47) - 2*sqrt(330) is positive, then the first expression squared is larger, meaning the original expression is larger.

That means the first expression squared is less than the second expression squared. Since both expressions are positive, that means the original second expression is larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(47). So, the larger number is sqrt(11) + sqrt(30).\n\nWait, let me double-check my approximations because sometimes the approximations can be a bit off. Let's see:\n\nsqrt(47) is between sqrt(36) = 6 and sqrt(49) = 7. 47 is 11 more than 36, so maybe 6 + 11/13 ≈ 6.846? Let me confirm with a calculator.\n\nWait, sqrt(47): 6^2 = 36, 7^2=49, so sqrt(47) ≈ 6.855 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(330): 18^2 = 324, 19^2=361, so sqrt(330) is 18 + (330 - 324)/ (2*18 + 1) ≈ 18 + 6/37 ≈ 18.162, so 2*sqrt(330) ≈ 36.324.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(47) ≈ 13.71, 2*sqrt(330) ≈ 36.324, so 7 + 13.71 - 36.324 ≈ 20.71 - 36.324 ≈ -15.614, which is negative. So, yes, the first expression squared is less than the second, so the original second expression is larger.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute the actual values numerically.\n\nCompute sqrt(1) + sqrt(47): sqrt(1) is 1, sqrt(47) is about 6.855, so total is about 7.855.\n\nCompute sqrt(11) + sqrt(30): sqrt(11) is about 3.3166, sqrt(30) is about 5.477, so total is about 8.7936.\n\nComparing 7.855 and 8.7936, 8.7936 is larger.\n\nSo, yeah, sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) is larger.\n\nI think this is solid.

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to compare sqrt(5) + sqrt(29) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(18). Hmm, okay. Let me see. I remember that sometimes you can compare square roots by squaring both sides, but I need to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extra solutions or make things more complicated. But in this case, since both sides are positive, squaring should preserve the inequality. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's note that sqrt(16) is 4, and sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2), which is approximately 4.2426. So sqrt(16) + sqrt(18) is 4 + 4.2426, which is about 8.2426. On the other hand, sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, and sqrt(29) is approximately 5.385. Adding those together gives me roughly 2.236 + 5.385 = 7.621. So, numerically, sqrt(16) + sqrt(18) is larger. But wait, let me check if that's true or if I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should square both expressions and compare the results. Let me denote A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(29) and B = sqrt(16) + sqrt(18). Then, A² = (sqrt(5) + sqrt(29))² and B² = (sqrt(16) + sqrt(18))². Let me compute both.\n\nStarting with A²: (sqrt(5) + sqrt(29))² = (sqrt(5))² + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(29) + (sqrt(29))² = 5 + 2*sqrt(145) + 29. So that simplifies to 5 + 29 = 34, plus 2*sqrt(145). So A² = 34 + 2*sqrt(145).\n\nNow, B²: (sqrt(16) + sqrt(18))² = (sqrt(16))² + 2*sqrt(16)*sqrt(18) + (sqrt(18))² = 16 + 2*sqrt(288) + 18. So that's 16 + 18 = 34, plus 2*sqrt(288). So B² = 34 + 2*sqrt(288).\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B². Both are 34 plus something. Let's look at the terms after 34: for A², it's 2*sqrt(145), and for B², it's 2*sqrt(288). So, which is larger: sqrt(145) or sqrt(288)?\n\nWait, but sqrt(288) can be simplified. Let me see, 288 divided by 144 is 2, so sqrt(288) = sqrt(144*2) = 12*sqrt(2). Similarly, sqrt(145) is just sqrt(145). So, now, we have A² = 34 + 2*sqrt(145) and B² = 34 + 2*12*sqrt(2). So, to compare 2*sqrt(145) and 2*12*sqrt(2).\n\nDivide both sides by 2: sqrt(145) vs 12*sqrt(2). Let's compute approximate values. sqrt(145) is approximately 12.0416, and 12*sqrt(2) is approximately 16.9706. So, 12*sqrt(2) is larger than sqrt(145), which means B² is larger than A². Therefore, B is larger than A.\n\nWait, but just to double-check my calculations. Let me compute sqrt(145) and sqrt(288). sqrt(145): 12^2 is 144, so sqrt(145) is 12 + (1/24), so approximately 12.0417. sqrt(288): 17^2 is 289, so sqrt(288) is just a bit less than 17, so around 16.9706. So, yes, 16.9706 is larger than 12.0417, so 2*sqrt(288) is larger than 2*sqrt(145). Therefore, B² is larger than A², so B is larger than A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider another approach. Let me think about the difference between B² and A². B² - A² = 34 + 2*sqrt(288) - (34 + 2*sqrt(145)) = 2*(sqrt(288) - sqrt(145)). Since sqrt(288) - sqrt(145) is positive, B² - A² is positive, so B² > A², so B > A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should compute the actual numerical values to see the difference. Let me compute A² and B² more precisely.\n\nFirst, A²: 34 + 2*sqrt(145). sqrt(145) is approximately 12.04159458. So 2*sqrt(145) is approximately 24.08318916. So A² ≈ 34 + 24.08318916 ≈ 58.08318916.\n\nB²: 34 + 2*sqrt(288). sqrt(288) is 12*sqrt(2) ≈ 12*1.41421356 ≈ 16.9705627. So 2*sqrt(288) ≈ 33.9411254. Therefore, B² ≈ 34 + 33.9411254 ≈ 67.9411254.\n\nSo, A² is approximately 58.083 and B² is approximately 67.941. So, B² is indeed larger. So, B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(16) + sqrt(18) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(29). So, the larger number is sqrt(16) + sqrt(18), which can be written as 4 + 3*sqrt(2). But the question says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, which a and b?\n\nWait, the original expressions are sqrt(5) + sqrt(29) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(18). Since sqrt(16) is 4, and sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2), so sqrt(16) + sqrt(18) is 4 + 3*sqrt(2). But in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), 4 can be written as sqrt(16), and 3*sqrt(2) is sqrt(9*2) = sqrt(18). So, sqrt(16) + sqrt(18) is the same as sqrt(16) + sqrt(18). So, that is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), where a is 16 and b is 18.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way to write sqrt(16) + sqrt(18) in another form? For example, could I combine them differently? sqrt(16) is 4, and sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2). So, 4 + 3*sqrt(2) is as simplified as it can get. So, the answer is sqrt(16) + sqrt(18). But just to make sure, is there a pair a and b where a ≠16 or b≠18? For example, if I write 4 + 3*sqrt(2) as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Let me think. Suppose sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) = 4 + 3*sqrt(2). Then, let me set sqrt(a) = 4 and sqrt(b) = 3*sqrt(2). Then, a=16, b=18. Alternatively, if I set sqrt(a) = something else. For example, suppose sqrt(a) = 3*sqrt(2) and sqrt(b) = 4. Then, a=18 and b=16. So, same thing. So, regardless of how I write it, the pair is a=16 and b=18 or a=18 and b=16. But since the question asks to write it as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), so either would be acceptable, but since a=16 and b=18, that's one way.\n\nAlternatively, is there a"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which is larger: sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) or sqrt(6) + sqrt(16). Hmm, let me start by calculating each part individually. \n\nFirst, sqrt(1) is straightforward. I know that the square root of 1 is 1 because 1 times 1 is 1. So, sqrt(1) = 1. \n\nNext, sqrt(49). I remember that 7 times 7 is 49, so sqrt(49) must be 7. Therefore, sqrt(49) = 7. \n\nSo, adding those together, sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) is 1 + 7, which equals 8. Okay, got that part down.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(6) + sqrt(16). Let me tackle each square root separately. \n\nStarting with sqrt(6). I don't remember the exact value of sqrt(6), but I know that 2 squared is 4 and 3 squared is 9. So sqrt(6) must be somewhere between 2 and 3. Maybe approximately 2.449? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll keep that in mind for now.\n\nThen, sqrt(16). That's easier because I know 4 times 4 is 16, so sqrt(16) is 4. \n\nSo, adding those together, sqrt(6) + sqrt(16) is approximately 2.449 + 4, which is about 6.449. That seems like a reasonable estimate.\n\nComparing the two results: 8 versus approximately 6.449. Clearly, 8 is larger. Therefore, sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(16).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check my calculations. \n\nFor sqrt(1), it's definitely 1. For sqrt(49), it's definitely 7. So, 1 + 7 is 8. \n\nFor sqrt(6), my estimation was about 2.449, but is there a more precise way to calculate it? Let me think. 2.449 squared is approximately (2.449)^2. Let's compute that: 2^2 is 4, 0.449^2 is about 0.2, and then cross terms are 2*2*0.449 = 1.796. So adding those up: 4 + 1.796 + 0.2 = approximately 5.996. Hmm, that's close to 6, which makes sense. So, 2.449 squared is roughly 6, so sqrt(6) is indeed approximately 2.449. \n\nAdding that to sqrt(16), which is 4, gives us 6.449. \n\nSo, 8 is definitely larger than 6.449. That seems solid. \n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can also express both sums without approximating and see if there's a way to compare them more precisely.\n\nSo, sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nsqrt(6) + sqrt(16) = sqrt(6) + 4.\n\nI can express sqrt(6) as sqrt(6). So, 4 + sqrt(6) is approximately 6.449, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to compare the two sums without approximating, I can consider the difference between them.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) = 8.\n\nLet me denote B = sqrt(6) + sqrt(16) ≈ 6.449.\n\nSo, A - B ≈ 8 - 6.449 = 1.551.\n\nThat's a positive number, which means A is larger than B by approximately 1.551.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that A is larger.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to square both expressions if I want to see which one is larger. Although, squaring might complicate things because of cross terms, but let me attempt it.\n\nLet me compute A squared and B squared and compare them.\n\nCompute A^2: (sqrt(1) + sqrt(49))^2 = (1 + 7)^2 = 8^2 = 64.\n\nCompute B^2: (sqrt(6) + sqrt(16))^2 = (sqrt(6) + 4)^2 = (sqrt(6))^2 + 2*sqrt(6)*4 + 4^2 = 6 + 8*sqrt(6) + 16 = 22 + 8*sqrt(6).\n\nNow, A^2 is 64, and B^2 is 22 + 8*sqrt(6).\n\nWe can compute 8*sqrt(6) to see if it's less than 64 - 22 = 42.\n\nCompute 8*sqrt(6): sqrt(6) is about 2.449, so 8*2.449 ≈ 19.592.\n\nSo, 22 + 19.592 ≈ 41.592.\n\nCompare that to A^2, which is 64. Since 41.592 < 64, that implies that B^2 < A^2, so B < A.\n\nTherefore, A is larger than B.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to see how much larger A is than B, I can compute the difference, which is 8 - B.\n\nSince B ≈ 6.449, 8 - 6.449 ≈ 1.551.\n\nSo, A is larger by approximately 1.551.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to express this difference without approximating, I could compute 8 - (sqrt(6) + 4) = 4 - sqrt(6).\n\nBut that's still a negative number, which would indicate that A is larger. Wait, 4 - sqrt(6) is about 4 - 2.449 = 1.551, which is positive, confirming that A is indeed larger by approximately 1.551.\n\nWait, but 4 - sqrt(6) is positive, so that's consistent with A being larger than B.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute this difference symbolically, I could write:\n\nA - B = (sqrt(1) + sqrt(49)) - (sqrt(6) + sqrt(16)) = (1 + 7) - (sqrt(6) + 4) = 8 - sqrt(6) - 4 = 4 - sqrt(6).\n\nWhich is positive, so that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, A is larger than B by exactly 4 - sqrt(6), which is approximately 1.551.\n\nSo, all these methods converge to the conclusion that sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(16).\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recap:\n\n- sqrt(1) = 1. Correct.\n- sqrt(49) = 7. Correct.\n- 1 + 7 = 8. Correct.\n\n- sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449. Correct.\n- sqrt(16) = 4. Correct.\n- 2.449 + 4 ≈ 6.449. Correct.\n\n- 8 - 6.449 ≈ 1.551. Correct.\n\n- Another way, A^2 = 64, B^2 ≈ 41.592. So, 64 > 41.592. Correct.\n\nThus, all these methods confirm that sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(16).\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(1) + sqrt(49), which is 8, but since the question asks to write it in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), which it already is, so the answer is sqrt(1) + sqrt(49).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)\", so I need to write it in that format. It already is sqrt(1) + sqrt(49), so that's fine. But just to make sure, maybe I can check if there's a different pair of a and b where the sum is larger.\n\nWait, for example, sqrt(2) + sqrt(48). Let me compute that.\n\nsqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, sqrt(48) ≈ 6.928. So, sum is about 8.342, which is larger than 8. So, that's another pair.\n\nBut the question is asking for which is larger, so either sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) or sqrt(2) + sqrt(48). But since sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) is already larger, regardless of other pairs, that's the answer.\n\nSimilarly, even sqrt(3) + sqrt("

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(4) + sqrt(26) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(14) or vice versa. Hmm, let me write down both expressions first to have a clear view.\n\nThe first one is sqrt(4) plus sqrt(26). I know that sqrt(4) is 2, so that simplifies the expression a bit. So, it becomes 2 + sqrt(26). Let me calculate the approximate value of sqrt(26). Since 5 squared is 25 and 5.1 squared is 26.01, so sqrt(26) is approximately 5.099. Therefore, the first expression is roughly 2 + 5.099, which is about 7.099.\n\nNow, the second expression is sqrt(11) plus sqrt(14). Let me compute each of these. I know that sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(11) is somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me approximate it. 3.3 squared is 10.89, 3.4 squared is 11.56. So sqrt(11) is approximately 3.316. Similarly, sqrt(14) is between 3 and 4 as well. 3.7 squared is 13.69, 3.8 squared is 14.44. So sqrt(14) is approximately 3.741. Adding these together, 3.316 + 3.741 is roughly 7.057.\n\nComparing the two approximate values: 7.099 for the first expression and 7.057 for the second. So, 7.099 is larger than 7.057, which means sqrt(4) + sqrt(26) is greater than sqrt(11) + sqrt(14).\n\nWait, let me double-check my approximations because sometimes these square roots can be tricky. For sqrt(26), I said it's about 5.099. Let me verify that with a calculator. 5.099 squared is approximately 26, since 5 squared is 25 and 5.099 squared is 26. Let me compute 5.099 * 5.099:\n\n5 * 5 = 25\n5 * 0.099 = 0.495\n0.099 * 5 = 0.495\n0.099 * 0.099 ≈ 0.0098\n\nAdding these up: 25 + 0.495 + 0.495 + 0.0098 ≈ 26.00.\n\nOkay, that seems correct. Similarly, sqrt(11) is approximately 3.316. Let's check 3.316 squared:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 0.316 = 0.948\n0.316 * 3 = 0.948\n0.316 * 0.316 ≈ 0.0998\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 0.948 + 0.948 + 0.0998 ≈ 11. So, that checks out.\n\nAnd sqrt(14) is approximately 3.741. Let me square that:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 0.741 = 2.223\n0.741 * 3 = 2.223\n0.741 * 0.741 ≈ 0.549\n\nAdding these: 9 + 2.223 + 2.223 + 0.549 ≈ 14. So, that's correct as well.\n\nTherefore, my initial approximations are accurate. So, the first expression is about 7.099 and the second is about 7.057, confirming that sqrt(4) + sqrt(26) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this without approximating, just by manipulating the expressions algebraically to see if I can compare them more precisely.\n\nLet me consider the two expressions:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(4) + sqrt(26) = 2 + sqrt(26)\nExpression B: sqrt(11) + sqrt(14)\n\nI can square both expressions to compare them.\n\nStarting with Expression A squared:\n\n(A)^2 = (2 + sqrt(26))^2 = 2^2 + 2*2*sqrt(26) + (sqrt(26))^2 = 4 + 4sqrt(26) + 26 = 30 + 4sqrt(26)\n\nSimilarly, Expression B squared:\n\n(B)^2 = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(14))^2 = (sqrt(11))^2 + 2*sqrt(11)*sqrt(14) + (sqrt(14))^2 = 11 + 2*sqrt(154) + 14 = 25 + 2sqrt(154)\n\nNow, I need to compare (A)^2 and (B)^2, which are 30 + 4sqrt(26) and 25 + 2sqrt(154) respectively.\n\nLet me subtract 25 from both sides:\n\n(30 - 25) + 4sqrt(26) = 5 + 4sqrt(26) vs. (25 - 25) + 2sqrt(154) = 0 + 2sqrt(154)\n\nSo, now I need to compare 5 + 4sqrt(26) and 2sqrt(154).\n\nLet me compute both sides numerically:\n\nFirst, 4sqrt(26):\n\nsqrt(26) ≈ 5.099, so 4*5.099 ≈ 20.396\n\nAdding 5 gives 5 + 20.396 ≈ 25.396\n\nNext, 2sqrt(154):\n\nsqrt(154) ≈ 12.409, so 2*12.409 ≈ 24.818\n\nComparing 25.396 and 24.818, 25.396 is larger.\n\nTherefore, (A)^2 - (B)^2 = 25.396 - 24.818 ≈ 0.578, which is positive. Hence, (A)^2 is greater than (B)^2, so A is greater than B.\n\nSo, that's another way to see that sqrt(4) + sqrt(26) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(14).\n\nAlternatively, is there another method? Maybe using the concept that for positive numbers a, b, c, d, (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)) is greater than (sqrt(c) + sqrt(d)) if a + b > c + d and sqrt(ab) > sqrt(cd). Wait, that might not be directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?\n\nBut perhaps it's getting too complicated. I think the methods I used are sufficient: approximating the values and squaring both expressions to compare them directly.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that sqrt(4) + sqrt(26) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(14).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{4} + \\sqrt{26}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{4} + \\sqrt{26}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{14}\\), we start by simplifying \\(\\sqrt{4}\\) to 2, so the first expression becomes \\(2 + \\sqrt{26}\\).\n\nNext, we approximate the values:\n- \\(\\sqrt{26} \\approx 5.099\\), so \\(2 + 5.099 \\approx 7.099\\).\n- For the second expression, we approximate \\(\\sqrt{11} \\approx 3.316\\) and \\(\\sqrt{14} \\approx 3.741\\), so their sum is approximately \\(3.316 + 3.741 \\approx 7.057\\).\n\nComparing these approximations, \\(7.099\\) is larger than \\(7.057\\), indicating that \\(\\sqrt{4} + \\sqrt{26}\\) is larger.\n\nTo confirm, we square both expressions:\n- \\((\\sqrt{4} + \\sqrt{26})^2 = (2 + \\sqrt{26})^2 = 4 + 4\\sqrt{26} + 26 = 30 + 4\\sqrt{26}\\).\n- \\((\\sqrt{11} + \\sqrt{14})^2 = (3.316 + 3.741)^2 \\approx 11 + 2\\"

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't play nicely with addition. I remember that squaring both sides of an inequality can sometimes make things easier, but I don't know if that's the best approach here. Maybe there's another way to compare them without dealing with square roots directly.\n\nI recall something about comparing sums of square roots by considering some sort of inequality or perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

Hmm, not sure if that directly applies here. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare the two expressions by looking at their squares.

To do this, let's compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nCalculating A^2:\nA^2 = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(44))^2 = (sqrt(14))^2 + 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(44) + (sqrt(44))^2\nSimplify:\n= 14 + 2*sqrt(14*44) + 44\n= 14 + 44 + 2*sqrt(616)\n= 58 + 2*sqrt(616)\n\nCalculating B^2:\nB^2 = (sqrt(22) + sqrt(41))^2 = (sqrt(22))^2 + 2*sqrt(22)*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))^2\nSimplify:\n= 22 + 41 + 2*sqrt(22*41)\n= 63 + 2*sqrt(902)\n\nOkay, so now I have A^2 = 58 + 2*sqrt(616) and B^2 = 63 + 2*sqrt(902). To compare A and B, I can compare A^2 and B^2.\n\nSo, let's compute the numerical values of A^2 and B^2 to see which is larger.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(616):\nI know that 24^2 = 576 and 25^2 = 625, so sqrt(616) is between 24 and 25. Let's calculate it more accurately.\n\n24.8^2 = (24 + 0.8)^2 = 24^2 + 2*24*0.8 + 0.8^2 = 576 + 38.4 + 0.64 = 615.04\nWow, that's really close to 616. So sqrt(616) is approximately 24.8 + (616 - 615.04)/(2*24.8) = 24.8 + (0.96)/49.6 ≈ 24.8 + 0.019 ≈ 24.819.\n\nSo sqrt(616) ≈ 24.819. Therefore, 2*sqrt(616) ≈ 49.638.\n\nTherefore, A^2 ≈ 58 + 49.638 ≈ 107.638.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(902):\n\nSimilarly, 30^2 = 900, so sqrt(902) is just a bit more than 30. Let's compute it.\n\n30.03^2 = (30 + 0.03)^2 = 30^2 + 2*30*0.03 + 0.03^2 = 900 + 1.8 + 0.0009 ≈ 901.8009\nWhich is just a bit less than 902. So let's try 30.03 + delta, where delta is small.\n\nCompute (30.03 + delta)^2 = 902.\n\nWe know that (30.03)^2 = approx 901.8009.\n\nSo, 2*30.03*delta + delta^2 = 902 - 901.8009 = 0.1991.\n\nAssuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible, so approximately:\n\n2*30.03*delta ≈ 0.1991\n\nSo delta ≈ 0.1991 / (2*30.03) ≈ 0.1991 / 60.06 ≈ 0.003315.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(902) ≈ 30.03 + 0.003315 ≈ 30.0333.\n\nThus, 2*sqrt(902) ≈ 60.0666.\n\nTherefore, B^2 ≈ 63 + 60.0666 ≈ 123.0666.\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 107.638 and B^2 ≈ 123.0666.\n\nSince 123.0666 > 107.638, B^2 > A^2, which means B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(22) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(44).\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But wait, let me double-check my calculations, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in estimating the square roots.\n\nFirst, sqrt(616):\n\n24.8^2 = 615.04\n\n616 - 615.04 = 0.96\n\nSo, 2*24.8*d = 0.96 => d = 0.96 / (2*24.8) = 0.96 / 49.6 ≈ 0.01938\n\nSo sqrt(616) ≈ 24.8 + 0.01938 ≈ 24.81938\n\nThus, 2*sqrt(616) ≈ 49.63876\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 58 + 49.63876 ≈ 107.63876\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, sqrt(902):\n\n30^2 = 900, so 30^2 = 900, so sqrt(902) is 30 + (902 - 900)/(2*30) = 30 + 2/60 ≈ 30.033333...\n\nBut let's compute more accurately.\n\nLet me compute 30.03^2:\n\n30.03^2 = (30 + 0.03)^2 = 30^2 + 2*30*0.03 + 0.03^2 = 900 + 1.8 + 0.0009 = 901.8009\n\nSo, 901.8009 is less than 902 by 0.1991.\n\nSo, to find delta such that (30 + delta)^2 = 902,\n\n(30 + delta)^2 = 900 + 60*delta + delta^2 = 902\n\nSo, 60*delta + delta^2 = 2\n\nAssuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible, so 60*delta ≈ 2 => delta ≈ 2/60 ≈ 0.03333333\n\nSo, sqrt(902) ≈ 30 + 0.033333 ≈ 30.033333\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(902) ≈ 60.066666\n\nThus, B^2 ≈ 63 + 60.066666 ≈ 123.066666\n\nSo, B^2 is indeed greater"

I need to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form of sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing the sums of square roots isn't straightforward because square roots are not linear functions. That is, the square root of a sum isn't the sum of the square roots. So, I can't just add sqrt(19) and sqrt(47) and compare that to sqrt(28) + sqrt(45). I have to find another way to compare them.\n\nMaybe I can square both expressions to make them comparable. If I square sqrt(19) + sqrt(47), I get (sqrt(19) + sqrt(47))^2, which is 19 + 47 + 2*sqrt(19*47). Similarly, squaring sqrt(28) + sqrt(45) gives (sqrt(28) + sqrt(45))^2, which is 28 + 45 + 2*sqrt(28*45).\n\nLet me compute these squares:\n\nFor sqrt(19) + sqrt(47):\n19 + 47 = 66\nsqrt(19*47): Let's compute 19*47. 20*47 is 940, subtract 1*47, which is 47, so 940 - 47 = 893. Therefore, sqrt(893). So, squared sum is 66 + 2*sqrt(893).\n\nFor sqrt(28) + sqrt(45):\n28 + 45 = 73\nsqrt(28*45): 28*45. Let's compute 28*40 = 1120, and 28*5=140, so total is 1120 + 140 = 1260. So, sqrt(1260). Therefore, squared sum is 73 + 2*sqrt(1260).\n\nNow, I need to compare 66 + 2*sqrt(893) and 73 + 2*sqrt(1260). The question is, which is larger? Because both expressions are sums of numbers, it might be tricky to compare them directly, but squaring them might help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can subtract one from the other and see if the result is positive or negative.\n\nLet me define A = sqrt(19) + sqrt(47) and B = sqrt(28) + sqrt(45). So, I need to see if A > B or A < B.\n\nCompute A - B = sqrt(19) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(28) - sqrt(45). I need to see if this is positive or negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both A and B, and then compare the squares.\n\nCompute A^2 = 66 + 2*sqrt(893)\nCompute B^2 = 73 + 2*sqrt(1260)\n\nNow, subtract A^2 from B^2: (73 + 2*sqrt(1260)) - (66 + 2*sqrt(893)) = 7 + 2*(sqrt(1260) - sqrt(893))\n\nSo, if 7 + 2*(sqrt(1260) - sqrt(893)) is positive or negative, that tells me whether B^2 is larger or smaller than A^2.\n\nSo, let's compute sqrt(1260) and sqrt(893). Maybe approximate them to see.\n\nFirst, sqrt(1260). Let's note that 35^2 = 1225 and 36^2 = 1296. So, sqrt(1260) is between 35 and 36. Let's approximate:\n\n35^2 = 1225\n35.5^2 = (35 + 0.5)^2 = 35^2 + 2*35*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 1225 + 35 + 0.25 = 1260.25\n\nWow, that's very close. So, sqrt(1260) is approximately 35.5, since 35.5^2 is 1260.25, which is just a bit more than 1260. So, sqrt(1260) ≈ 35.5 - epsilon, where epsilon is small.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute sqrt(893). Let's see, 29^2 = 841, 30^2 = 900. So, sqrt(893) is between 29 and 30. Maybe 29.8^2 = ?\n\nCompute 29.8^2:\n\n= (30 - 0.2)^2 = 30^2 - 2*30*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 900 - 12 + 0.04 = 888.04\n\nHmm, 29.8^2 = 888.04, which is less than 893. Difference is 893 - 888.04 = 4.96.\n\nSo, the next step is to find how much more beyond 29.8. Let's denote x = 29.8 + delta, such that x^2 = 893.\n\nWe have (29.8 + delta)^2 = 893\n\nCompute 29.8^2 = 888.04\n\nSo, 888.04 + 2*29.8*delta + delta^2 = 893\n\nAssuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible. So:\n\n888.04 + 59.6*delta ≈ 893\n\nSubtract 888.04: 59.6*delta ≈ 4.96\n\nSo, delta ≈ 4.96 / 59.6 ≈ 0.0833\n\nSo, sqrt(893) ≈ 29.8 + 0.0833 ≈ 29.8833\n\nTherefore, sqrt(893) ≈ 29.8833.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1260) ≈ 35.5.\n\nSo, sqrt(1260) - sqrt(893) ≈ 35.5 - 29.8833 ≈ 5.6167\n\nSo, going back to the expression 7 + 2*(sqrt(1260) - sqrt(893)) ≈ 7 + 2*(5.6167) ≈ 7 + 11.2334 ≈ 18.2334.\n\nWhich is positive. So, 7 + 2*(sqrt(1260) - sqrt(893)) ≈ 18.2334 > 0\n\nTherefore, B^2 - A^2 ≈ 18.2334 > 0, which implies B^2 > A^2. Therefore, B > A.\n\nSo, sqrt(28) + sqrt(45) is larger than sqrt(19) + sqrt(47).\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(28) + sqrt(45), so I can write that in the box.\n\nWait, let me verify the computations again because approximations can sometimes lead to errors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute sqrt(19) ≈ 4.3589, sqrt(47) ≈ 6.8557, so sqrt(19) + sqrt(47) ≈ 4.3589 + 6.8557 ≈ 11.2146.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915, sqrt(45) ≈ 6.7082, so sqrt(28) + sqrt(45) ≈ 5.2915 + 6.7082 ≈ 11.9997.\n\nSo, approximately, sqrt(28) + sqrt(45) is about 12, and sqrt(19) + sqrt(47) is about 11.21. So, 12 > 11.21, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, that gives me confidence that sqrt(28) + sqrt(45) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, another method: Maybe use the inequality that for positive numbers, the sum of square roots can be compared by looking at their squares, as I did, but perhaps another way is to note that sqrt(28) is sqrt(4*7) = 2*sqrt"

Let's start with A².\n\nA² = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(47))²\n     = (sqrt(8))² + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(47) + (sqrt(47))²\n     = 8 + 2*sqrt(8*47) + 47\n     = 8 + 2*sqrt(376) + 47\n     = 55 + 2*sqrt(376)\n\nNow, let's compute B².\n\nB² = (sqrt(20) + sqrt(43))²\n     = (sqrt(20))² + 2*sqrt(20)*sqrt(43) + (sqrt(43))²\n     = 20 + 2*sqrt(20*43) + 43\n     = 20 + 2*sqrt(860) + 43\n     = 63 + 2*sqrt(860)\n\nSo now, I have A² = 55 + 2*sqrt(376) and B² = 63 + 2*sqrt(860). I need to compare these two.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values to see which one is bigger. Maybe that will help me figure out.\n\nFirst, sqrt(376). Let me calculate that. I know that 19² is 361 and 20² is 400, so sqrt(376) is between 19 and 20. Let me find a closer approximation.\n\n376 - 361 = 15. So, sqrt(376) = 19 + 15/(2*19) approximately, using linear approximation. So that's 19 + 15/38 ≈ 19 + 0.3947 ≈ 19.3947.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(376) ≈ 2*19.3947 ≈ 38.7894.\n\nTherefore, A² ≈ 55 + 38.7894 ≈ 93.7894.\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(860). Similarly, I know that 29² is 841 and 30² is 900, so sqrt(860) is between 29 and 30.\n\n860 - 841 = 19. So, sqrt(860) = 29 + 19/(2*29) ≈ 29 + 19/58 ≈ 29 + 0.3276 ≈ 29.3276.\n\nThus, 2*sqrt(860) ≈ 2*29.3276 ≈ 58.6552.\n\nTherefore, B² ≈ 63 + 58.6552 ≈ 121.6552.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 93.7894 and B² ≈ 121.6552. Since 121.6552 is greater than 93.7894, that means B² > A². Therefore, B > A.\n\nWait, hold on, so the original question was comparing A = sqrt(8) + sqrt(47) and B = sqrt(20) + sqrt(43). I found that B² is greater, so B is larger.\n\nBut wait, hold on, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you approximate square roots, things can go wrong.\n\nWait, let's recalculate A² and B² without approximating the square roots as much.\n\nA² = 55 + 2*sqrt(376). Let's compute sqrt(376) more accurately. 19² is 361, 20² is 400. So, 376 is 15 above 361. So, sqrt(376)=19 + 15/(2*19) = 19 + 0.3947 ≈ 19.3947. So, 2*sqrt(376)≈38.7894. So, A²≈55+38.7894≈93.7894. That seems correct.\n\nB²=63 + 2*sqrt(860). sqrt(860): 29²=841, 29.5²=870.25. So, 860 is 19 less than 870.25. So, sqrt(860)=29.5 - 19/(2*29.5)=29.5 - 19/59≈29.5 - 0.322≈29.178. Therefore, 2*sqrt(860)=58.356. So, B²≈63 + 58.356≈121.356.\n\nWait, so 121.356 is greater than 93.7894, so B² > A², so B > A.\n\nWait, but another way to check is to actually compute the approximate decimal values of sqrt(8), sqrt(47), sqrt(20), sqrt(43).\n\nLet me compute sqrt(8): sqrt(4*2)=2*sqrt(2)≈2*1.4142≈2.8284.\n\nsqrt(47): sqrt(49 - 2)=sqrt(47). Let me compute 6²=36, 7²=49. So, sqrt(47) is between 6 and 7. 6.8²=46.24, 6.9²=47.61. So, sqrt(47) is between 6.8 and 6.9.\n\nCompute 6.8²=46.24, 47 - 46.24=0.76. So, 6.8 + 0.76/(2*6.8)=6.8 + 0.76/13.6≈6.8 + 0.055≈6.855. So, sqrt(47)≈6.855.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(20): sqrt(16 + 4)=sqrt(20). 4²=16, 5²=25. So, sqrt(20) is between 4 and 5. 4.4²=19.36, 4.5²=20.25. So, sqrt(20) is between 4.4 and 4.5.\n\nCompute 4.4²=19.36, 4.4 + (20 - 19.36)/(2*4.4)=4.4 + 0.64/8.8≈4.4 + 0.0727≈4.4727. So, sqrt(20)≈4.4721 (exact value is about 4.4721).\n\nsqrt(43): similar approach. 6²=36, 7²=49. So, sqrt(43) is between 6 and 7. 6.5²=42.25, which is very close to 43. So, sqrt(43)≈6.568 (since 6.568²≈43.03).\n\nSo, let's write down approximate values:\n\nsqrt(8)≈2.8284,\n\nsqrt(47)≈6.855,\n\nsqrt(20)≈4.4721,\n\nsqrt(43)≈6.568.\n\nSo, A = sqrt(8) + sqrt(47)≈2.8284 + 6.855≈9.6834.\n\nB = sqrt(20) + sqrt(43)≈4.4721 + 6.568≈11.0401.\n\nSo"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(10) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(14) + sqrt(18). I need to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably simplify any of the square roots that can be simplified. Looking at sqrt(49), that's straightforward because 49 is a perfect square. So sqrt(49) is just 7. That means the first expression simplifies to sqrt(10) + 7. Got that down.\n\nNow, the second expression is sqrt(14) + sqrt(18). Hmm, let me see if these can be simplified further. 14 is not a perfect square, because 3^2 is 9 and 4^2 is 16, so sqrt(14) is irrational and can't be simplified. Similarly, 18 is also not a perfect square because 4^2 is 16 and 5^2 is 25, so sqrt(18) is also irrational. Therefore, we might need to approximate these values or find another way to compare them without relying on decimal approximations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions to see which one is larger. Since both expressions are sums of square roots, squaring them might help me compare them more easily. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the first expression as A, so A = sqrt(10) + 7, and the second as B = sqrt(14) + sqrt(18). I need to compare A and B. Let me compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nCalculating A^2:\nA^2 = (sqrt(10) + 7)^2\n= (sqrt(10))^2 + 2*sqrt(10)*7 + 7^2\n= 10 + 14*sqrt(10) + 49\n= 59 + 14*sqrt(10)\n\nCalculating B^2:\nB^2 = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(18))^2\n= (sqrt(14))^2 + 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(18) + (sqrt(18))^2\n= 14 + 2*sqrt(14*18) + 18\n= 32 + 2*sqrt(252)\n\nSimplify sqrt(252). Let me see, 252 can be factored into 4*63, because 4*63 is 252. So sqrt(252) is sqrt(4*63) which is 2*sqrt(63). Therefore, B^2 becomes:\n32 + 2*(2*sqrt(63))\n= 32 + 4*sqrt(63)\n\nSo now, I have A^2 = 59 + 14*sqrt(10) and B^2 = 32 + 4*sqrt(63). I need to compare these two values. Since sqrt(10) and sqrt(63) are both irrational numbers, I can't compute them exactly, but I can approximate them to see which is larger.\n\nFirst, let me find approximate values for sqrt(10) and sqrt(63).\n\nsqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623.\n\nsqrt(63) is approximately 7.9373.\n\nSo plugging these into A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 ≈ 59 + 14*(3.1623)\n= 59 + (14*3.1623)\nLet me compute 14*3.1623:\n14*3 = 42\n14*0.1623 ≈ 14*0.16 = 2.24 and 14*0.0023 ≈ 0.0322, so total ≈ 2.24 + 0.0322 ≈ 2.2722\nSo total ≈ 42 + 2.2722 = 44.2722\nTherefore, A^2 ≈ 59 + 44.2722 ≈ 103.2722\n\nSimilarly, B^2 ≈ 32 + 4*(7.9373)\n= 32 + 4*7.9373\nCompute 4*7.9373:\n4*7 = 28\n4*0.9373 ≈ 3.7492\nSo total ≈ 28 + 3.7492 ≈ 31.7492\nTherefore, B^2 ≈ 32 + 31.7492 ≈ 63.7492\n\nWait a minute, hold on. Let me double-check that because 4*7.9373 should be 31.7492, but 32 + 31.7492 is 63.7492, not 63.7492? No, that's correct.\n\nWait, but A^2 is approximately 103.2722 and B^2 is approximately 63.7492. So 103.2722 is greater than 63.7492, which means A^2 > B^2. Therefore, since both A and B are positive numbers, if their squares are compared and A^2 > B^2, then A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(10) + 7 is greater than sqrt(14) + sqrt(18). So the larger number is sqrt(10) + 7, which can be written as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) where a = 10 and b = 49. Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(10) + sqrt(49).\n\nWait, but let me just verify this because sometimes when squaring, especially if the numbers are larger, I might have made a mistake in calculations. Let me recompute A^2 and B^2.\n\nStarting with A = sqrt(10) + 7.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(10) + 7)^2\n= (sqrt(10))^2 + 2*sqrt(10)*7 + 7^2\n= 10 + 14*sqrt(10) + 49\n= 59 + 14*sqrt(10)\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, 14*sqrt(10) is approximately 14*3.1623 = 44.2722. So 59 + 44.2722 = 103.2722. That looks correct.\n\nNow, B = sqrt(14) + sqrt(18).\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(18))^2\n= (sqrt(14))^2 + 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(18) + (sqrt(18))^2\n= 14 + 2*sqrt(14*18) + 18\n= 32 + 2*sqrt(252)\n\nNow, sqrt(252) is sqrt(4*63) = 2*sqrt(63) ≈ 2*7.9373 ≈ 15.8746\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(252) ≈ 2*15.8746 ≈ 31.7492\n\nThus, B^2 ≈ 32 + 31.7492 ≈ 63.7492\n\nSo A^2 ≈ 103.2722 and B^2 ≈ 63.7492. Hence, A^2 is indeed greater than B^2, so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(10) + 7 is greater than sqrt(14) + sqrt(18). So the larger number is sqrt(10) + sqrt(49). Wait, but sqrt(49) is 7, so it's just sqrt(10) + 7. So, in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), it's sqrt(10) + sqrt(49). Alternatively, it could also be written as sqrt(10) + sqrt(7^2), but in any case, the problem says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\" So, as long as a and b are positive integers, which they are, this should be acceptable.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute the approximate values numerically to confirm.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(10) + 7 ≈ 3.1623 + 7 ≈ 10.1623\n\nCompute B = sqrt(14) + sqrt(18) ≈ 3.7417 + 4.2426 ≈ 7.9843\n\nWait, hold"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(3) + sqrt(31) and sqrt(15) + sqrt(25). Hmm, let me see how I can approach this. Maybe I can calculate each sum numerically to see which one is larger. That might be straightforward.\n\nFirst, let me find the approximate values of each square root.\n\nStarting with sqrt(3). I know that sqrt(1) is 1 and sqrt(4) is 2, so sqrt(3) is somewhere between 1 and 2. Let me recall that sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732.\n\nNext, sqrt(31). Hmm, that's a bit higher. Let me think, sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(31) is between 5 and 6. To get a better approximation, I can use the fact that 5.5 squared is 30.25, which is just a bit less than 31. So sqrt(31) is approximately 5.568.\n\nNow, adding sqrt(3) and sqrt(31) together: 1.732 + 5.568. Let me add those up. 1.732 + 5 is 6.732, and then adding 0.568 gives me approximately 7.299 + 0.568? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1.732 + 5.568 is just adding the two decimals. Let me do it properly. 1.732 + 5.568: 1 + 5 is 6, 0.732 + 0.568 is 1.3. So total is 7.3. Okay, so sqrt(3) + sqrt(31) is approximately 7.3.\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(15) + sqrt(25). I know sqrt(25) is 5. What about sqrt(15)? sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(15) is somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me approximate it. 15 is closer to 16 than to 9, so sqrt(15) is closer to 4. Maybe around 3.872 or something. Let me check 3.872 squared: 3.872 * 3.872. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3 * 3 is 9. 3 * 0.872 is 2.616. So 3.872 squared is approximately 14.99. That's really close to 15. So sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872.\n\nSo sqrt(15) + sqrt(25) is 3.872 + 5, which is 8.872.\n\nComparing the two sums: sqrt(3) + sqrt(31) is approximately 7.3, and sqrt(15) + sqrt(25) is approximately 8.872. Therefore, sqrt(15) + sqrt(25) is larger.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my approximations. Let me verify sqrt(31) again. 5.5 squared is 30.25, as I thought earlier. So 5.5 squared is 30.25, which is less than 31. So sqrt(31) is a little more than 5.5. Let me compute 5.5 squared is 30.25, as before. Then 5.5 squared is 30.25, so sqrt(31) is 5.5 + (31 - 30.25)/(2*5.5). That's an approximation using the linear approximation formula.\n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2*sqrt(x)). So at x=30.25, sqrt(x)=5.5, the derivative is 1/(2*5.5) = 1/11 ≈ 0.0909.\n\nSo, the approximate sqrt(31) is 5.5 + (31 - 30.25)*0.0909 ≈ 5.5 + 0.75*0.0909 ≈ 5.5 + 0.068 ≈ 5.568. So that checks out with my earlier approximation.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(3) I approximated as 1.732. To check that, 1.732 squared is approximately 2.999, which is about 3, so that's correct.\n\nSo, my calculations seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both sums to compare them without calculating the square roots. Let me try that as another method.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(3) + sqrt(31) and B = sqrt(15) + sqrt(25). I can compute A^2 and B^2 and compare them.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(3) + sqrt(31))^2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(3*31) + 31 = 3 + 31 + 2*sqrt(93) = 34 + 2*sqrt(93).\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(15) + sqrt(25))^2 = 15 + 2*sqrt(15*25) + 25 = 15 + 25 + 2*sqrt(375) = 40 + 2*sqrt(375).\n\nNow, to compare A^2 and B^2, I can subtract B^2 from A^2:\n\nA^2 - B^2 = (34 + 2*sqrt(93)) - (40 + 2*sqrt(375)) = -6 + 2*(sqrt(93) - sqrt(375)).\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 = -6 + 2*sqrt(93) - 2*sqrt(375). Let's compute each term:\n\nsqrt(93) is approximately 9.6436, so 2*sqrt(93) ≈ 19.287.\n\nsqrt(375) is sqrt(25*15) = 5*sqrt(15) ≈ 5*3.872 ≈ 19.36.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(375) ≈ 38.72.\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 ≈ -6 + 19.287 - 38.72 ≈ (-6 + 19.287) - 38.72 ≈ 13.287 - 38.72 ≈ -25.433.\n\nSince A^2 - B^2 is negative, that means A^2 < B^2. Therefore, A < B.\n\nSo, again, sqrt(15) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(3) + sqrt(31). Therefore, B is larger.\n\nWait, so both methods give me the same result? The first method with approximate decimal values, and the second method with squaring and comparing. So, both confirm that sqrt(15) + sqrt(25) is larger.\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Maybe by considering the properties of square roots and how adding them behaves.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the function f(x) = sqrt(x). It's a concave function, so by Jensen's inequality, the sum of concave functions is also concave, but I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Maybe not the most straightforward approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare each term:\n\nsqrt(15) is greater than sqrt(3), but sqrt(25) is equal to 5, while sqrt(31) is greater than sqrt(31). Wait, that might not be helpful because they are being added together.\n\nWait, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, sqrt(25) is 5. So, 3.872 + 5 = 8.872.\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, sqrt(31) is approximately 5.568, so 1.732 + 5.568 = 7.299 + 0.568 ≈ 7.3. So that's consistent with the earlier approximation.\n\nSo, 8.872 is definitely larger than 7.3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the difference between the two sums:\n\nsqrt(15) + sqrt(25) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(31)) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) + (sqrt(25) - sqrt(31)).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nsqrt(15) - sqrt(3): sqrt(15) is approx 3.872, sqrt(3) is approx 1.732, so difference is approx 2"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(25) + sqrt(27). Hmm, let me write down what each one is. \n\nFirst, sqrt(18) is... Well, 18 is 9 times 2, so sqrt(18) should be sqrt(9*2) which is sqrt(9)*sqrt(2) = 3*sqrt(2). That's right, because sqrt(9) is 3. \n\nThen, sqrt(49) is straightforward since 49 is a perfect square. So sqrt(49) is 7. \n\nSo, adding those together, sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) is 3*sqrt(2) + 7. \n\nWait, hold on, 3*sqrt(2) is approximately... Let me calculate that. sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 3*1.414 is roughly 4.242. So 4.242 + 7 is approximately 11.242. \n\nOkay, got that. Now, let's look at the other expression: sqrt(25) + sqrt(27). \n\nsqrt(25) is easy, that's 5. \n\nNow, sqrt(27)... Hmm, 27 is 9 times 3, so sqrt(27) is sqrt(9*3) = sqrt(9)*sqrt(3) = 3*sqrt(3). \n\nApproximately, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 is roughly 5.196. \n\nAdding that to 5, we get 5 + 5.196, which is approximately 10.196. \n\nSo, comparing the two, 11.242 versus 10.196. So sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) is larger. \n\nBut wait, the question asks me to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).

Let me think. \n\nWait, maybe I can consider the individual terms. sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2), sqrt(49) is 7. So, 3*sqrt(2) is equal to sqrt(18). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) equals sqrt(18) + sqrt(49). Maybe a and b can be arranged in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps if I square both expressions to compare them, since squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers.\n\nSo, let me compute (sqrt(18) + sqrt(49))² and (sqrt(25) + sqrt(27))².\n\nFirst, (sqrt(18) + sqrt(49))² = (3*sqrt(2) + 7)². Let's expand that:\n\n(3*sqrt(2))² + 2*(3*sqrt(2))*7 + 7²\n\n= 9*2 + 42*sqrt(2) + 49\n\n= 18 + 42*sqrt(2) + 49\n\n= 67 + 42*sqrt(2)\n\nHmm, that's one expression.\n\nNow, (sqrt(25) + sqrt(27))² = (5 + 3*sqrt(3))².\n\nExpanding that:\n\n5² + 2*5*3*sqrt(3) + (3*sqrt(3))²\n\n= 25 + 30*sqrt(3) + 9*3\n\n= 25 + 30*sqrt(3) + 27\n\n= 52 + 30*sqrt(3)\n\nSo, now I have both squared terms:\n\n67 + 42*sqrt(2) versus 52 + 30*sqrt(3)\n\nWhich one is larger? Hmm, let me compute the numerical values.\n\nFirst, 67 + 42*sqrt(2). Well, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so 42*1.414 is about 59.388. So 67 + 59.388 is approximately 126.388.\n\nSecond, 52 + 30*sqrt(3). sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 30*1.732 is about 51.96. So 52 + 51.96 is approximately 103.96.\n\nSo, 126.388 is larger than 103.96. Therefore, (sqrt(18) + sqrt(49))² is larger than (sqrt(25) + sqrt(27))², which means sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(25) + sqrt(27). \n\nSo, the larger number is sqrt(18) + sqrt(49). Wait, but the question says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)\". So, is sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)? Yes, because it's sqrt(18) + sqrt(49), so a=18 and b=49.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Is there another way to express sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) where a and b are different? For example, maybe a= something else.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that a and b have to be different or anything else, so I think sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) is acceptable as the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\n\nAlternatively, if I want to write it in terms of different square roots, maybe 3*sqrt(2) + 7, but that's not in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, perhaps the answer is sqrt(18) + sqrt(49), and that's in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects a single sqrt(a) expression, but since it says \"sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)\", I think sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) is the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the initial problem statement. It says: \"Compare sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(25) + sqrt(27). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\"\n\nSo, the larger number is sqrt(18) + sqrt(49), and we need to write it in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, a=18 and b=49. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(18) + sqrt(49). \n\nBut just to make sure, I want to verify my calculations again.\n\nFirst, sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2), correct, because 18=9*2.\n\nsqrt(49) is 7, that's straightforward.\n\nSo, sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) is 3*sqrt(2) + 7, which is approximately 4.242 + 7 = 11.242.\n\nNow, sqrt(25) is 5, and sqrt(27) is 3*sqrt(3), which is approximately 5.196.\n\nSo, 5 + 5.196 is approximately 10.196, which is less than 11.242.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(18) + sqrt(49) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute (sqrt(18) + sqrt(49))² = (3*sqrt(2) + 7)² = 18 + 42*sqrt(2) + 49 = 67 + 42*sqrt(2). \n\nAnd (sqrt(25) + sqrt(27))² = (5 + 3*sqrt(3))² = 25 + 30*sqrt(3) + 27 = 52 + 30*sqrt(3). \n\nSo, numerically, 67 + 42*sqrt(2) is approximately 67 + 59.388 = 126.388, and 52 + 30*sqrt(3) is approximately 52 + 51.96 = 103.96. So, yeah, 126.388 is larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(18"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) is larger than sqrt(20) + sqrt(36) or vice versa. Hmm, let me write down both expressions so I can compare them more easily.\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(7) + sqrt(43)\nSecond expression: sqrt(20) + sqrt(36)\n\nWait, sqrt(36) is a nice number because it simplifies to 6. So the second expression can be rewritten as sqrt(20) + 6. Maybe that helps me compare it more easily.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values of each term to get a rough idea of their sizes.\n\nStarting with the first expression:\nsqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458\nsqrt(43) is approximately 6.5574\nAdding them together: 2.6458 + 6.5574 ≈ 9.2032\n\nNow the second expression:\nsqrt(20) is approximately 4.4721\nsqrt(36) is 6, so 4.4721 + 6 = 10.4721\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. If sqrt(20) is about 4.4721 and sqrt(36) is 6, adding them gives 10.4721, which is larger than the first expression's 9.2032. But hold on, I thought sqrt(20) is about 4.47, which is correct, and sqrt(36) is definitely 6, so 4.47 + 6 is 10.47, which is bigger than 9.2032. So that suggests sqrt(20) + sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nBut let me double-check because sometimes when you approximate, things can seem off. Maybe I should calculate the exact values more precisely.\n\nCalculating sqrt(7) more precisely:\nsqrt(7) ≈ 2.6457513110645906\n\nCalculating sqrt(43):\nsqrt(43) ≈ 6.557438524910698\n\nAdding them together:\n2.6457513110645906 + 6.557438524910698 ≈ 9.203189835975289\n\nCalculating sqrt(20):\nsqrt(20) ≈ 4.472135955038835\n\nAdding sqrt(20) and sqrt(36):\n4.472135955038835 + 6 = 10.472135955038835\n\nSo yes, 10.472135955 is definitely larger than 9.203189835975289.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me think if there's another way to compare them without calculating the approximate decimal values because sometimes intuition can be misleading.\n\nI remember that for positive numbers, if a > b, then sqrt(a) + sqrt(c) could be compared to sqrt(b) + sqrt(d) depending on how the terms interact. But in this case, since 43 is a much larger number than 36, maybe sqrt(43) is significantly larger than sqrt(36), whereas sqrt(20) is not as large as sqrt(7). So perhaps the combined effect makes sqrt(20) + sqrt(36) larger.\n\nAlternatively, I can square both expressions to see which one is larger without dealing with the square roots. Let me try that.\n\nLet’s denote A = sqrt(7) + sqrt(43)\nLet’s denote B = sqrt(20) + sqrt(36)\n\nI need to compare A and B. Let me square both A and B.\n\nFirst, A squared:\nA² = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(43))² = 7 + 2*sqrt(7*43) + 43 = 50 + 2*sqrt(301)\n\nSimilarly, B squared:\nB² = (sqrt(20) + sqrt(36))² = 20 + 2*sqrt(20*36) + 36 = 56 + 2*sqrt(720)\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B².\n\nSo, A² is 50 + 2*sqrt(301)\nB² is 56 + 2*sqrt(720)\n\nSubtracting 50 from both, we get:\n\nA² - 50 = 2*sqrt(301)\nB² - 56 = 2*sqrt(720)\n\nSo, to compare A² and B², we can compare 2*sqrt(301) and 2*sqrt(720). Since 2 is positive, it won't affect the inequality, so we can just compare sqrt(301) and sqrt(720). Which is obviously smaller because 301 < 720. Therefore, sqrt(301) < sqrt(720), so 2*sqrt(301) < 2*sqrt(720). Therefore, A² < B², which implies A < B.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(20) + sqrt(36), which is equal to sqrt(20) + 6. So, in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), that would be sqrt(20) + sqrt(36).\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure that I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recalculate A² and B².\n\nCalculating A²:\nsqrt(7) + sqrt(43) squared:\n= 7 + 2*sqrt(7*43) + 43\n= 50 + 2*sqrt(301)\nThat's correct because 7 + 43 is 50, and 2*sqrt(301) is correct because 7*43 is 301.\n\nCalculating B²:\nsqrt(20) + sqrt(36) squared:\n= 20 + 2*sqrt(20*36) + 36\n= 56 + 2*sqrt(720)\nThat's correct because 20 + 36 is 56, and 2*sqrt(720) is correct because 20*36 is 720.\n\nComparing A² and B²:\nA² = 50 + 2*sqrt(301)\nB² = 56 + 2*sqrt(720)\n\nSo, A² - B² = (50 - 56) + (2*sqrt(301) - 2*sqrt(720)) = -6 + 2*(sqrt(301) - sqrt(720))\n\nSince sqrt(301) < sqrt(720), the term (sqrt(301) - sqrt(720)) is negative. Therefore, 2*(sqrt(301) - sqrt(720)) is negative.\n\nTherefore, A² - B² = -6 + negative number, which is definitely negative. Therefore, A² < B², so A < B.\n\nYep, that seems consistent. So, sqrt(20) + sqrt(36) is larger than sqrt(7) + sqrt(43).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using the triangle inequality or something else? I don't think the triangle inequality applies directly here since we're dealing with sums of square roots. Maybe another way is to consider vectors or something, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider squaring both sides without constants to see if that helps. Let me suppose that A < B, so sqrt(7) + sqrt(43) < sqrt(20) + sqrt(36). Then, squaring both sides, we get A² < B², which we already did. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that 43 is 36 + 7, so sqrt(43) = sqrt(36 + 7). So, maybe we can write sqrt(36 + 7) and sqrt(20) as separate terms.\n\nBut I think the previous method is solid because it directly squares both expressions, and since we can compare the squared values, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap: sqrt(20) + sqrt(36) is larger than sqrt(7) + sqrt(43). Therefore, in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), the larger number is sqrt(20) + sqrt(36).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{36}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{43}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{36}\\), we start by noting that \\(\\sqrt{36} = 6\\).

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(6) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(8) + sqrt(25). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(6) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(8) + sqrt(25). I have to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what sqrt means. The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So sqrt(6) is a number that, when squared, gives 6. Similarly, sqrt(36) is a number that, when squared, gives 36. Since 6 squared is 36, sqrt(36) must be 6. That simplifies things a bit for the second expression.\n\nWait, let me write that down step by step to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nStarting with sqrt(6) + sqrt(36):\n- sqrt(6) is just sqrt(6), which is approximately 2.449.\n- sqrt(36) is 6, because 6*6=36.\n- So adding them together: 2.449 + 6 ≈ 8.449.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(8) + sqrt(25).\n- sqrt(25) is 5, because 5*5=25.\n- sqrt(8) is a bit trickier since 8 isn't a perfect square. The square root of 8 can be simplified as 2*sqrt(2) because 8 is 4*2 and sqrt(4) is 2. So sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2) ≈ 2.828.\n- Adding them together: 2.828 + 5 ≈ 7.828.\n\nComparing the two results: approximately 8.449 vs. approximately 7.828. Clearly, 8.449 is larger than 7.828. So, sqrt(6) + sqrt(36) is larger than sqrt(8) + sqrt(25).\n\nBut wait, the question wants me to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). In this case, the larger number is sqrt(6) + sqrt(36). But let me double-check if that's indeed the largest.\n\nIs there a possibility that sqrt(8) + sqrt(25) could be larger if I rearrange or choose different a and b? Hmm. Let me consider the expressions again.\n\nsqrt(6) + sqrt(36) can be written as sqrt(6) + sqrt(6^2). Similarly, sqrt(8) + sqrt(25) can be written as sqrt(8) + sqrt(5^2). Maybe I can compare these expressions without calculating their approximate decimal values.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(6) + sqrt(36) and B = sqrt(8) + sqrt(25). So A = sqrt(6) + 6 and B = sqrt(8) + 5. Maybe I can compare A and B by subtracting 5 from both sides, so A - 5 = sqrt(6) + 1 and B = sqrt(8) + 5. Wait, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider each term separately. sqrt(6) is less than sqrt(8), right? Because 6 < 8, so sqrt(6) < sqrt(8). Similarly, sqrt(36) is 6, which is greater than sqrt(25) which is 5. So we have sqrt(6) < sqrt(8) and sqrt(36) > sqrt(25). So which effect is stronger?\n\nI think in this case, since sqrt(36) is significantly larger than sqrt(25), even though sqrt(6) is smaller than sqrt(8), the difference might make the total sum larger. Let me test this.\n\nCompute A - B:\nA - B = (sqrt(6) + 6) - (sqrt(8) + 5) = sqrt(6) - sqrt(8) + 1.\n\nNow, I need to determine whether sqrt(6) - sqrt(8) is positive or negative. Since sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45 and sqrt(8) is approximately 2.828, so sqrt(6) - sqrt(8) ≈ -0.378. Therefore, A - B ≈ -0.378 + 1 = 0.622, which is positive. Therefore, A > B.\n\nSo indeed, sqrt(6) + sqrt(36) is larger than sqrt(8) + sqrt(25). So the answer is sqrt(6) + sqrt(36). But wait, the question specifies writing down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). In this case, a = 6 and b = 36. So the larger number is sqrt(6) + sqrt(36). Alternatively, maybe I can write it as sqrt(6) + sqrt(6^2) or something, but that's already in the required form.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure that sqrt(6) + sqrt(36) is indeed the correct expression. Since sqrt(36) is 6, which is a perfect square, so that term is already simplified. So the expression is sqrt(6) + 6, which is the same as sqrt(6) + sqrt(36). Therefore, in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), a = 6 and b = 36.\n\nSo, the larger number is sqrt(6) + sqrt(36). So I should write that as the final answer.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me compute both values more precisely to ensure that my initial approximation was correct.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(6) + 6:\nsqrt(6) ≈ 2.449489743\nAdding 6: 2.449489743 + 6 ≈ 8.449489743\n\nCompute B = sqrt(8) + 5:\nsqrt(8) ≈ 2.828427125\nAdding 5: 2.828427125 + 5 ≈ 7.828427125\n\nSo, A ≈ 8.44949 and B ≈ 7.82843. Therefore, A is indeed larger. So, the conclusion is clear.\n\nWait, hold on another second. Let me consider whether sqrt(6) + sqrt(36) is indeed the largest. Could there be another combination of a and b that gives a larger sum? For example, what if I take sqrt(9) + sqrt(25)? But sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(25) is 5, so 3 + 5 = 8, which is less than A. Alternatively, sqrt(16) + sqrt(25) is 4 + 5 = 9, which is larger than A. But sqrt(16) is 4, which is a perfect square, so sqrt(16) is 4, but the question is about sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So if I take sqrt(16) + sqrt(25) = 4 + 5 = 9, which is actually larger than A.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. So, hold on, let me check. If I take sqrt(16) + sqrt(25) = 4 + 5 = 9, which is approximately 9, which is larger than A, which was approximately 8.449. So in that case, sqrt(16) + sqrt(25) is larger.\n\nBut wait, why did I think sqrt(6) + sqrt(36) was the largest earlier? Maybe I was mistaken because when I compared sqrt(8) + sqrt(25) ≈ 7.828 vs sqrt(16) + sqrt(25) = 9, so 9 is larger. But wait, if I take sqrt(16) + sqrt(25) = 9, but sqrt(16) is 4, which is a perfect square, so that's acceptable. So, is 9 the largest? Or is there even a larger one?\n\nWait, let me test with a=16 and b=25, giving 9. What about a=25 and b=25? sqrt(25) + sqrt(25) = 5 + 5 = 10, which is even larger.\n\nWait, hold on, so that suggests that as a and b increase, the sum sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) can get larger. So if a and b can be any positive numbers, then sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) can be made arbitrarily large by choosing larger a and b. But in the problem statement, it's not clear what a and b are supposed to be. It's just asking to compare sqrt(6) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(8) + sqrt(25), and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So maybe I was overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because the problem didn't specify a and b"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(9) + sqrt(26) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(17). Hmm, let me take it step by step because I'm not entirely sure how to approach this. Maybe I can simplify each square root first?\n\nStarting with sqrt(9). That's straightforward because 9 is a perfect square. So sqrt(9) is 3. Cool, that part is easy.\n\nNext, sqrt(26). I don't think 26 is a perfect square, so I'll have to work with an approximate value. Let me recall that 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36. So sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(36) is 6. That means sqrt(26) is just a little bit more than 5, maybe around 5.1 or something. Let me see if I can get a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to square 5.1 to see if it gets me closer to 26. So 5.1 squared is 26.01. Oh, that's really close. So sqrt(26) is approximately 5.099. Maybe I can just write it as 5.1 for simplicity.\n\nNow moving on to the second part: sqrt(16) + sqrt(17). Again, sqrt(16) is straightforward. 16 is a perfect square, so sqrt(16) is 4. That part is easy too.\n\nNow, sqrt(17). Similar to sqrt(26), 17 isn't a perfect square. So I need to find its approximate value. Let me think. 4 squared is 16 and 5 squared is 25, so sqrt(17) is between 4 and 5. Maybe around 4.1 or something. Let me check 4.1 squared: 4.1*4.1 is 16.81. Hmm, that's still a bit less than 17.\n\nTrying 4.12 squared: 4.12*4.12. Let's calculate that. 4*4 is 16, 4*0.12 is 0.48, 0.12*4 is 0.48, and 0.12*0.12 is 0.0144. Adding all those together: 16 + 0.48 + 0.48 + 0.0144 = 16 + 0.96 + 0.0144 = 16.9744. Hmm, that's pretty close to 17. So, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nsqrt(9) + sqrt(26) is approximately 3 + 5.1 = 8.1.\n\nsqrt(16) + sqrt(17) is approximately 4 + 4.123 = 8.123.\n\nSo, comparing 8.1 and 8.123, which one is larger? Well, 8.123 is larger than 8.1 because 0.023 is more than 0.01.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(16) + sqrt(17) is larger than sqrt(9) + sqrt(26). So, the larger number is sqrt(16) + sqrt(17).\n\nBut wait, before I conclude, maybe I should check my calculations more precisely because approximations can sometimes lead to errors, especially with square roots.\n\nLet me try to calculate sqrt(26) more accurately. Since 5.1^2 is 26.01, which is just 0.01 more than 26. So, sqrt(26) is 5.099019514 approximately. Let me write that as 5.099 for simplicity.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(17). Since 4.12^2 is 16.9744, which is 0.0256 less than 17. So, sqrt(17) is 4.12 + (0.0256)/(2*4.12) using linear approximation. That is, sqrt(17) ≈ 4.12 + 0.0256/(8.24) ≈ 4.12 + 0.0031 ≈ 4.1231.\n\nOkay, so using more precise approximations, sqrt(26) is approximately 5.099 and sqrt(17) is approximately 4.1231.\n\nCalculating sqrt(9) + sqrt(26): 3 + 5.099 ≈ 8.099.\n\nCalculating sqrt(16) + sqrt(17): 4 + 4.1231 ≈ 8.1231.\n\nSo, 8.099 vs. 8.1231. Clearly, 8.1231 is larger. So, sqrt(16) + sqrt(17) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, another method: maybe I can square both expressions to compare them more precisely?\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(9) + sqrt(26) and B = sqrt(16) + sqrt(17). I want to compare A and B.\n\nCompute A^2 = (sqrt(9) + sqrt(26))^2 = 9 + 2*sqrt(9*26) + 26 = 35 + 2*sqrt(234).\n\nSimilarly, compute B^2 = (sqrt(16) + sqrt(17))^2 = 16 + 2*sqrt(16*17) + 17 = 33 + 2*sqrt(272).\n\nSo, A^2 = 35 + 2*sqrt(234) and B^2 = 33 + 2*sqrt(272).\n\nNow, to compare A^2 and B^2, we can subtract B^2 from A^2:\n\nA^2 - B^2 = (35 - 33) + 2*(sqrt(234) - sqrt(272)) = 2 + 2*(sqrt(234) - sqrt(272)).\n\nSo, is 2 + 2*(sqrt(234) - sqrt(272)) positive? Well, sqrt(234) is sqrt(272 - 38). So sqrt(234) is less than sqrt(272). Therefore, sqrt(234) - sqrt(272) is negative. Let me compute the exact value.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the numerical values:\n\nsqrt(234): Let's see, 15^2=225, 16^2=256, so sqrt(234) is between 15 and 16. Let's compute 15.3^2: 15.3*15.3=234.09. Oh, wait, that's very close. So sqrt(234) ≈ 15.297 approximately.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(272): 16^2=256, 17^2=289, so sqrt(272) is between 16 and 17. 16.5^2=272.25. So sqrt(272) is approximately 16.492.\n\nSo, sqrt(234) ≈ 15.297 and sqrt(272) ≈ 16.492.\n\nSo, sqrt(234) - sqrt(272) ≈ 15.297 - 16.492 ≈ -1.195.\n\nTherefore, A^2 - B^2 = 2 + 2*(-1.195) = 2 - 2.39 ≈ -0.39.\n\nSo, A^2 is approximately -0.39 less than B^2, which means A^2 < B^2. Therefore, A < B.\n\nSo, that's another way to see that sqrt(16) + sqrt(17) is larger than sqrt(9) + sqrt(26).\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(16) + sqrt(17).\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me check another method, maybe using calculus or something else.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the function f(x) = sqrt(x) and see if it's concave or convex. Since the second derivative of sqrt(x) is negative, it's concave. So, by Jensen's inequality, for concave functions, the function evaluated at the average is greater than or equal to the average of the function.\n\nBut in this case, I have two different square roots being added, so maybe that doesn't directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the difference between A and B and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nBut actually, I think the two methods I used are sufficient: computing the decimal approximations and squaring the expressions.\n\nBoth methods point to sqrt(16)"

Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, interesting. I remember that to compare sums of square roots, sometimes it's helpful to rationalize or find a common form. Maybe I can simplify each expression first?\n\nLet me start with sqrt(12). I know that 12 can be factored into 4 times 3, and since 4 is a perfect square, that should help. So, sqrt(12) is sqrt(4*3), which is sqrt(4)*sqrt(3), right? That becomes 2*sqrt(3). Okay, that simplifies nicely.\n\nNext, sqrt(50). Similarly, 50 is 25 times 2. 25 is a perfect square, so sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2), which is sqrt(25)*sqrt(2) = 5*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(50) simplifies to 5*sqrt(2). Now, the first sum becomes 2*sqrt(3) + 5*sqrt(2).\n\nNow moving on to the second expression: sqrt(15) + sqrt(28). Let me see if I can simplify these as well. Starting with sqrt(15): 15 is 3*5, neither of which are perfect squares, so that doesn't simplify further. So, sqrt(15) stays as it is.\n\nNow, sqrt(28). 28 factors into 4*7, and 4 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(28) is sqrt(4*7) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(7). Therefore, sqrt(28) simplifies to 2*sqrt(7). So, the second sum becomes sqrt(15) + 2*sqrt(7).\n\nNow, we have both expressions simplified:\n\nFirst sum: 2*sqrt(3) + 5*sqrt(2)\nSecond sum: sqrt(15) + 2*sqrt(7)\n\nHmm, so now I need to compare 2*sqrt(3) + 5*sqrt(2) and sqrt(15) + 2*sqrt(7). I wonder if there's a way to compare them without calculating the decimal values? Maybe by squaring both sides? That could work because if I square the larger expression, it might be greater than the square of the smaller one.\n\nLet me denote A = 2*sqrt(3) + 5*sqrt(2) and B = sqrt(15) + 2*sqrt(7). To compare A and B, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and see which is larger.\n\nCalculating A^2:\n(2*sqrt(3) + 5*sqrt(2))^2\n= (2*sqrt(3))^2 + 2*(2*sqrt(3))*(5*sqrt(2)) + (5*sqrt(2))^2\n= 4*3 + 2*(10*sqrt(6)) + 25*2\n= 12 + 20*sqrt(6) + 50\n= 62 + 20*sqrt(6)\n\nCalculating B^2:\n(sqrt(15) + 2*sqrt(7))^2\n= (sqrt(15))^2 + 2*(sqrt(15))*(2*sqrt(7)) + (2*sqrt(7))^2\n= 15 + 4*sqrt(105) + 4*7\n= 15 + 4*sqrt(105) + 28\n= 43 + 4*sqrt(105)\n\nNow, I need to compare 62 + 20*sqrt(6) and 43 + 4*sqrt(105). Let's subtract 43 from both sides to make it easier:\n\n62 - 43 + 20*sqrt(6) vs. 4*sqrt(105)\nWhich is 19 + 20*sqrt(6) vs. 4*sqrt(105)\n\nHmm, still a bit messy, but maybe I can approximate the values to see which is larger.\n\nFirst, let's approximate sqrt(6). I know that sqrt(4) is 2 and sqrt(9) is 3, so sqrt(6) is about 2.45.\n\nSo, 20*sqrt(6) is approximately 20*2.45 = 49.\n\nTherefore, 19 + 49 = 68.\n\nNow, sqrt(105). Let's see, sqrt(100) is 10, so sqrt(105) is a bit more, maybe around 10.25.\n\nSo, 4*sqrt(105) is approximately 4*10.25 = 41.\n\nSo, now comparing 68 vs. 41. Clearly, 68 is larger. Therefore, A^2 > B^2, which means A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(12) + sqrt(50) is larger than sqrt(15) + sqrt(28).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, A^2:\n(2*sqrt(3) + 5*sqrt(2))^2\n= (2*sqrt(3))^2 + 2*(2*sqrt(3))*(5*sqrt(2)) + (5*sqrt(2))^2\n= 4*3 + 20*sqrt(6) + 25*2\n= 12 + 50 + 20*sqrt(6)\n= 62 + 20*sqrt(6)\nThat looks correct.\n\nB^2:\n(sqrt(15) + 2*sqrt(7))^2\n= 15 + 4*sqrt(105) + 28\n= 43 + 4*sqrt(105)\nThat also looks correct.\n\nThen, when subtracting 43 from both sides, I get:\n\n19 + 20*sqrt(6) vs. 4*sqrt(105)\n\nCalculating 20*sqrt(6): sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45, so 20*2.45 = 49. So, 19 + 49 = 68.\n\n4*sqrt(105): sqrt(105) is approximately 10.25, so 4*10.25 = 41.\n\nSo, 68 vs. 41. Definitely, 68 is larger. Therefore, A is larger than B.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute the actual decimal values of A and B to confirm.\n\nCompute A = 2*sqrt(3) + 5*sqrt(2):\n\nsqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 2*1.732 = 3.464.\n\nsqrt(2) is about 1.414, so 5*1.414 = 7.07.\n\nAdding them together: 3.464 + 7.07 ≈ 10.534.\n\nCompute B = sqrt(15) + 2*sqrt(7):\n\nsqrt(15) is about 3.872.\n\nsqrt(7) is about 2.645, so 2*2.645 = 5.290.\n\nAdding them together: 3.872 + 5.290 ≈ 9.162.\n\nSo, A ≈ 10.534 and B ≈ 9.162. Clearly, A is larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(12) + sqrt(50) is larger than sqrt(15) + sqrt(28). So, the answer should be sqrt(12) + sqrt(50), which can be written as sqrt(12) + sqrt(50). But wait, the problem says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\" So, I need to present it as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), where a and b are integers. Hmm, is there a way to write sqrt(12) as sqrt( something )? Well, 12 is 4*3, so sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). Similarly, sqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2). So, both are already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), I think.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem expects a and b to be such that a and b are as small as possible? Or maybe just to express in terms of sqrt(3) and sqrt(2). Since 12 and 50 are already multiples of squares, I think that's fine. So, I think the answer is sqrt(12) + sqrt(50). But let me see if it's possible to write them in another way.\n\nWait, sqrt(12"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(21) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(36) + sqrt(39) or vice versa. Hmm, let me start by simplifying each expression as much as possible because that might make it easier to compare them.\n\nFirst, let's look at sqrt(49). That's straightforward since 49 is a perfect square. So sqrt(49) is just 7. That simplifies the first expression a lot. So now, the first expression becomes sqrt(21) + 7.\n\nNext, let's tackle the second expression: sqrt(36) + sqrt(39). Again, sqrt(36) is a perfect square because 36 is 6 squared. So sqrt(36) is 6. That means the second expression simplifies to 6 + sqrt(39).\n\nNow, I have two simplified expressions: sqrt(21) + 7 and 6 + sqrt(39). I need to figure out which one is larger. Maybe I can compare them term by term or see if I can manipulate them to be easier to compare.\n\nLet me write them down again:\n\n1. sqrt(21) + 7\n2. 6 + sqrt(39)\n\nHmm, both expressions have a constant term and a radical term. Maybe I can subtract one from the other to see the difference. Let's see.\n\nSubtracting the second expression from the first:\n\n(sqrt(21) + 7) - (6 + sqrt(39)) = sqrt(21) + 7 - 6 - sqrt(39) = sqrt(21) + 1 - sqrt(39)\n\nSo, sqrt(21) + 1 - sqrt(39) is the difference between the first expression and the second. If this is positive, then the first expression is larger; if it's negative, the second one is larger.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(21) and sqrt(39) approximately to see what this difference might be.\n\nsqrt(21) is approximately 4.5837 because 4.5837^2 ≈ 21.\n\nsqrt(39) is approximately 6.2449 because 6.2449^2 ≈ 39.\n\nPlugging these values back into the difference:\n\n4.5837 + 1 - 6.2449 ≈ 5.5837 - 6.2449 ≈ -0.6612\n\nSo, the difference is approximately -0.6612, which is negative. That means that sqrt(21) + 7 is less than 6 + sqrt(39). Therefore, sqrt(36) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(21) + sqrt(49).\n\nWait a second, let me verify that. Maybe my approximations were too rough. Let me use more accurate calculations.\n\nLet me calculate sqrt(21) more precisely. 4.5837^2 is 21, but let's see:\n\n4.5837^2 = (4.5 + 0.0837)^2 = 4.5^2 + 2*4.5*0.0837 + 0.0837^2 = 20.25 + 0.7563 + 0.00701 ≈ 20.25 + 0.7563 + 0.00701 ≈ 21.01331. Hmm, that's actually a bit more than 21. So maybe sqrt(21) is approximately 4.58366.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(39): 6.2449^2. Let me compute 6.2449^2:\n\n6^2 = 36\n0.2449^2 ≈ 0.05997\nCross term: 2*6*0.2449 ≈ 2.9388\nSo total is approximately 36 + 2.9388 + 0.05997 ≈ 38 + 0.00077 ≈ 38.00077, which is still a little less than 39.\n\nSo, 6.2449^2 ≈ 38.00077, so to get 39, we need a slightly higher number. Let's say 6.245^2:\n\n6.245^2 = (6 + 0.245)^2 = 36 + 2*6*0.245 + 0.245^2 = 36 + 2.94 + 0.060025 ≈ 36 + 2.94 + 0.060025 ≈ 39.000025.\n\nWow, that's pretty accurate. So sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245.\n\nSo, going back to the difference:\n\nsqrt(21) ≈ 4.58366\n\nsqrt(39) ≈ 6.245\n\nSo, sqrt(21) + 1 ≈ 4.58366 + 1 = 5.58366\n\nsqrt(39) ≈ 6.245\n\nSo, 5.58366 - 6.245 ≈ -0.66134\n\nSo, the difference is approximately -0.66134, which is negative. Therefore, sqrt(21) + 7 is less than 6 + sqrt(39). Therefore, sqrt(36) + sqrt(39) is larger.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe squaring both expressions? Since I know both expressions are positive, squaring them will preserve the inequality.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(21) + 7 and B = 6 + sqrt(39). I want to compare A and B.\n\nCompute A^2 and B^2.\n\nCompute A^2: (sqrt(21) + 7)^2 = (sqrt(21))^2 + 2*sqrt(21)*7 + 7^2 = 21 + 14*sqrt(21) + 49 = 70 + 14*sqrt(21).\n\nCompute B^2: (6 + sqrt(39))^2 = 6^2 + 2*6*sqrt(39) + (sqrt(39))^2 = 36 + 12*sqrt(39) + 39 = 75 + 12*sqrt(39).\n\nNow, compare A^2 and B^2:\n\n70 + 14*sqrt(21) vs. 75 + 12*sqrt(39)\n\nSo, 70 + 14*sqrt(21) vs. 75 + 12*sqrt(39)\n\nLet me write the difference as 70 + 14*sqrt(21) - 75 - 12*sqrt(39) = -5 + 14*sqrt(21) - 12*sqrt(39)\n\nSo, if I can show that -5 + 14*sqrt(21) - 12*sqrt(39) is less than zero, that would mean A^2 < B^2, hence A < B.\n\nSo, let's compute 14*sqrt(21) - 12*sqrt(39):\n\n14*sqrt(21) ≈ 14*4.58366 ≈ 14*4 + 14*0.58366 ≈ 56 + 8.17124 ≈ 64.17124\n\n12*sqrt(39) ≈ 12*6.2449 ≈ 12*6 + 12*0.2449 ≈ 72 + 2.9388 ≈ 74.9388\n\nSo, 64.17124 - 74.9388 ≈ -10.76756\n\nSo, -5 + (-10.76756) ≈ -15.76756 < 0\n\nTherefore, A^2 - B^2 ≈ -15.76756 < 0, which means A^2 < B^2, so A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(36) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(21) + sqrt(49).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe another approach. Let me think about how sqrt(21) compares to sqrt(39). Since 21 is less than 39, sqrt(21) is less than sqrt(39). So, sqrt(21) + 7 is less than sqrt(39) + 7, but we have sqrt(36) + sqrt(3"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(15) + sqrt(45) and sqrt(36) + sqrt(41). I have to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(36) is 6 because 6 squared is 36. That seems straightforward. So, if I can simplify sqrt(45), maybe I can compare it to sqrt(15) or something else. Let me see. sqrt(45) can be simplified because 45 is 9 times 5, right? So, sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) which is sqrt(9)*sqrt(5), which is 3*sqrt(5). Okay, so sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5). Hmm, that might help.\n\nSo, if I rewrite sqrt(45) as 3*sqrt(5), then the second expression becomes 6 + 3*sqrt(5). Let me write that down:\n\nsqrt(15) + sqrt(45) = sqrt(15) + 3*sqrt(5)\n\nAnd the other expression is 6 + 3*sqrt(5). So, both expressions have a 3*sqrt(5) term. That means I can subtract 3*sqrt(5) from both expressions to compare the remaining parts. Let's do that.\n\nFor the first expression: sqrt(15) + 3*sqrt(5) minus 3*sqrt(5) is just sqrt(15). For the second expression: 6 + 3*sqrt(5) minus 3*sqrt(5) is just 6. So, now I can compare sqrt(15) and 6.\n\nWait a second, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872 because 3.872 squared is about 15. So, 3.872 is less than 6. Therefore, the first expression, sqrt(15) + sqrt(45), is less than the second expression, sqrt(36) + sqrt(41). Hmm, that seems to make sense.\n\nBut let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes when you simplify radicals, things can get tricky. Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, I simplified sqrt(45) as 3*sqrt(5). That's correct because 45 divided by 9 is 5, and sqrt(9) is 3. So, that part is solid.\n\nThen, I expressed both expressions in terms of 3*sqrt(5) and subtracted that term from both, leaving me with sqrt(15) and 6. That also seems correct because sqrt(45) is entirely separate, so when I subtract it, it just leaves sqrt(15) or 6.\n\nNow, comparing sqrt(15) to 6. I know sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(15) is just a little less than 4, specifically about 3.872. So, yeah, 3.872 is less than 6. So, the first expression is less than the second.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(36) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(15) + sqrt(45). So, I need to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Looking at the original expressions, the second one is sqrt(36) + sqrt(41). So, that's sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) where a is 36 and b is 41.\n\nLet me just make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in my simplification. Is sqrt(45) equal to 3*sqrt(5)? Yes, because 45 is 9*5, and sqrt(9) is 3. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd sqrt(36) is 6, which is also correct. So, subtracting 3*sqrt(5) from both expressions leaves us with sqrt(15) and 6, which we compared correctly. So, yeah, that should be solid.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Just to make sure, let me calculate both expressions numerically to confirm.\n\nCalculating sqrt(15) + sqrt(45):\n\nsqrt(15) is approximately 3.872,\n\nsqrt(45) is approximately 6.708,\n\nAdding them together: 3.872 + 6.708 is approximately 10.580.\n\nNow, calculating sqrt(36) + sqrt(41):\n\nsqrt(36) is 6,\n\nsqrt(41) is approximately 6.403,\n\nAdding them together: 6 + 6.403 is approximately 12.403.\n\nSo, 10.580 versus 12.403. Clearly, 12.403 is larger. So, that confirms my earlier conclusion. Therefore, sqrt(36) + sqrt(41) is indeed larger.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(36) + sqrt(41), which is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), so I just need to write that as the answer.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The problem says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\" So, since the second expression is sqrt(36) + sqrt(41), that's already in the desired form. So, I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure that I didn't overlook any other possible simplifications or mistakes in my initial approach.\n\nAnother way to compare sqrt(15) + sqrt(45) and sqrt(36) + sqrt(41) is to square both expressions and compare the results. Since both expressions are positive, squaring them won't affect the inequality.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(15) + sqrt(45) and B = sqrt(36) + sqrt(41). Then, A^2 = (sqrt(15) + sqrt(45))^2 and B^2 = (sqrt(36) + sqrt(41))^2.\n\nCalculating A^2:\n\n= (sqrt(15))^2 + 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(45) + (sqrt(45))^2\n\n= 15 + 2*sqrt(15*45) + 45\n\n= 60 + 2*sqrt(675)\n\nSimilarly, calculating B^2:\n\n= (sqrt(36))^2 + 2*sqrt(36)*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))^2\n\n= 36 + 2*sqrt(36*41) + 41\n\n= 77 + 2*sqrt(1476)\n\nSo, now, I need to compare A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 = 60 + 2*sqrt(675)\n\nB^2 = 77 + 2*sqrt(1476)\n\nSo, let me compute the numerical values to see which one is larger.\n\nFirst, sqrt(675): 675 is 25*27, so sqrt(675) = 5*sqrt(27). sqrt(27) is about 5.196, so 5*5.196 is about 25.98. So, 2*sqrt(675) is approximately 51.96.\n\nTherefore, A^2 ≈ 60 + 51.96 = 111.96.\n\nNow, sqrt(1476): Let's see, 38^2 is 1444, 39^2 is 1521. So, sqrt(1476) is between 38 and 39. Let me calculate 38^2 = 1444, 38.5^2 = 1482.25, which is just over 1476. So, sqrt(1476) is 38.5 - a bit.\n\nLet me calculate 38.5^2: 38*38 + 2*38*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 1444 + 38 + 0.25 = 1482.25. So, 1476 is 1482.25 - 6.25. So, sqrt(1476) is 38.5 - delta, where delta is such that (38.5 - delta)^2 = 1476.\n\nApproximating, since (38.5 - delta)^2 ≈ 38.5^2 - 2*38.5*delta. So, 1482.25 - 77*delta = 1476. So, 77*delta ≈ 6.25, so delta ≈ 6.25 / 77 ≈ 0.081. So, sqrt(1476) ≈ 38.5 - 0.081"

Let's compute sqrt(322) and sqrt(264) approximately to see their values.\n\nCalculating sqrt(322):\n\nWell, 17² = 289, 18² = 324. So sqrt(322) is just a little less than 18, approximately 17.944.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(264):\n\n16² = 256, 17² = 289, so sqrt(264) is between 16 and 17.

So sqrt(264) ≈ 16.24.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(322) ≈ 17.944 and sqrt(264) ≈ 16.24.\n\nSo, 1 + sqrt(322) - sqrt(264) ≈ 1 + 17.944 - 16.24 ≈ 1 + 1.704 ≈ 2.704.\n\nTherefore, B² - A² ≈ 2*(2.704) ≈ 5.408.\n\nSince this is positive, B² > A², which implies B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(14) + sqrt(23) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(24).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me double-check my approximations because sometimes approximations can be misleading.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(322) again:\n\n17² = 289\n\n17.9² = (17 + 0.9)² = 17² + 2*17*0.9 + 0.9² = 289 + 30.6 + 0.81 = 320.41\n\n17.95² = (17.9 + 0.05)² = 17.9² + 2*17.9*0.05 + 0.05² = 320.41 + 1.79 + 0.0025 ≈ 322.2025\n\nSo, 17.95² ≈ 322.2025, which is just over 322. So sqrt(322) ≈ 17.95.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(264):\n\n16.2² = 262.44\n\n16.25² = (16 + 0.25)² = 16² + 2*16*0.25 + 0.25² = 256 + 8 + 0.0625 = 264.0625\n\nSo, 16.25² = 264.0625, which is just over 264. Therefore, sqrt(264) ≈ 16.25 - a tiny bit.\n\nBut let's compute 16.24²:\n\n16² = 256\n\n0.24² = 0.0576\n\n2*16*0.24 = 7.68\n\nSo, 16.24² = 256 + 7.68 + 0.0576 = 263.7376\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 16.24² is 263.7376, which is less than 264.\n\nSo, 16.24² = 263.7376\n\n16.25² = 264.0625\n\nSo, sqrt(264) is between 16.24 and 16.25.\n\nTo approximate it, let's see the difference between 264 and 263.7376.\n\n264 - 263.7376 = 0.2624\n\nThe difference between 16.25² and 16.24² is 264.0625 - 263.7376 = 0.3249\n\nSo, 0.2624 / 0.3249 ≈ 0.808\n\nTherefore, sqrt(264) ≈ 16.24 + 0.808*(0.01) ≈ 16.24 + 0.00808 ≈ 16.24808\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(322) is just a bit less than 17.95, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, 1 + sqrt(322) - sqrt(264) ≈ 1 + 17.944 - 16.248 ≈ 1 + 1.696 ≈ 2.696\n\nTherefore, B² - A² ≈ 2*2.696 ≈ 5.392, which is positive. Thus, B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(14) + sqrt(23) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(24).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute A² and B² numerically with more precision to see if my previous approximation was correct.\n\nCalculating A²:\n\nA² = 35 + 2*sqrt(264)\n\nWe know that sqrt(264) ≈ 16.24808\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(264) ≈ 2*1"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to compare sqrt(13) + sqrt(46) and sqrt(42) + sqrt(45). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't play nice like addition or multiplication do. So, I need a strategy to figure out which sum is bigger. Maybe I can compute each sum numerically and see which one is larger? But wait, I should be careful because sometimes even if one sum is bigger, the actual difference might be too small to detect just by adding them up. Maybe there's a smarter way than just calculating the decimals.\n\nI remember something about comparing sums of square roots by squaring both expressions. That might work here. Let me recall: if I have two expressions, say sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) and sqrt(c) + sqrt(d), to compare them, I can square both and see which is larger. The square of sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) is a + b + 2*sqrt(ab), and similarly, the square of sqrt(c) + sqrt(d) is c + d + 2*sqrt(cd). If a + b + 2*sqrt(ab) > c + d + 2*sqrt(cd), then sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) is larger. So, maybe I can apply this method here.\n\nLet me apply that to the given problem. Let me denote A = sqrt(13) + sqrt(46) and B = sqrt(42) + sqrt(45). Then, I need to compute A² and B² and compare them.\n\nCalculating A²:\n\nA² = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(46))² = 13 + 46 + 2*sqrt(13*46) = 59 + 2*sqrt(598)\n\nCalculating B²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(42) + sqrt(45))² = 42 + 45 + 2*sqrt(42*45) = 87 + 2*sqrt(1890)\n\nNow, I need to compare 59 + 2*sqrt(598) and 87 + 2*sqrt(1890). Hmm. Let me compute the numerical values of these square roots to see which is bigger.\n\nFirst, sqrt(598). Let me figure that out. I know that 24² = 576 and 25² = 625, so sqrt(598) is between 24 and 25. Let me try 24.5²: 24.5² = (24 + 0.5)² = 24² + 2*24*0.5 + 0.5² = 576 + 24 + 0.25 = 599 + 0.25. Wait, that's 599.25, which is just a bit over 598. So, sqrt(598) is just a bit less than 24.5. Maybe around 24.48 or something.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1890). Hmm, let's see. 43² = 1849 and 44² = 1936. So, sqrt(1890) is between 43 and 44. Let me try 43.5²: 43.5² = (43 + 0.5)² = 43² + 2*43*0.5 + 0.5² = 1849 + 43 + 0.25 = 1892.25. That's just a bit over 1890, so sqrt(1890) is just a little less than 43.5, maybe around 43.4.\n\nNow, let's plug these approximations back into A² and B².\n\nA² ≈ 59 + 2*24.48 ≈ 59 + 48.96 ≈ 107.96\n\nB² ≈ 87 + 2*43.4 ≈ 87 + 86.8 ≈ 173.8\n\nWait a minute, 107.96 vs. 173.8. So, B² is larger. Therefore, B is larger than A. So, sqrt(42) + sqrt(45) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(46). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(42) + sqrt(45).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my approximations because sometimes it's easy to make an error in squaring numbers.\n\nFirst, sqrt(598): 24.5² = 599.25, which is 0.25 over. So, sqrt(598) = 24.5 - (0.25)/(2*24.5) ≈ 24.5 - 0.0051 ≈ 24.4949. So, approximately 24.495.\n\nThen, 2*sqrt(598) ≈ 2*24.495 ≈ 48.99.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 59 + 48.99 ≈ 107.99, which is about 108.\n\nNow, sqrt(1890): 43.5² = 1892.25, which is 2.25 over 1890. So, sqrt(1890) = 43.5 - 2.25/(2*43.5) ≈ 43.5 - 0.026 ≈ 43.474.\n\nThen, 2*sqrt(1890) ≈ 2*43.474 ≈ 86.948.\n\nSo, B² ≈ 87 + 86.948 ≈ 173.948, which is about 174.\n\nSo, 108 vs. 174. Definitely, B² is larger. Therefore, B is larger than A.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approximate or maybe an exact comparison.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare (sqrt(42) + sqrt(45))² vs. (sqrt(13) + sqrt(46))² as I did, but could I find a way to see if 59 + 2*sqrt(598) is less than 87 + 2*sqrt(1890)?\n\nLet me subtract A² from B²:\n\nB² - A² = (87 + 2*sqrt(1890)) - (59 + 2*sqrt(598)) = 28 + 2*(sqrt(1890) - sqrt(598))\n\nSo, if 28 + 2*(sqrt(1890) - sqrt(598)) > 0, then B² > A², which would mean B > A.\n\nSo, is sqrt(1890) - sqrt(598) positive? Yes, because 1890 > 598, so sqrt(1890) > sqrt(598). Therefore, their difference is positive.\n\nNow, how much is that difference? Let me compute sqrt(1890) - sqrt(598). Hmm, 43.474 - 24.495 ≈ 18.979.\n\nSo, 2*(18.979) ≈ 37.958.\n\nThen, 28 + 37.958 ≈ 65.958.\n\nWhich is positive. So, B² - A² ≈ 65.958 > 0, so B² > A², which means B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(42) + sqrt(45) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is to see how much each term contributes. Let me see.\n\nBut hold on, before I conclude, maybe I can compute the actual decimal values of A and B to get a better sense.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(13) ≈ 3.6055, sqrt(46) ≈ 6.7823. So, A ≈ 3.6055 + 6.7823 ≈ 10.3878.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(42) ≈ 6.4807, sqrt(45) ≈ 6.7082. So, B ≈ 6.4807 + 6.7082 ≈ 13.1889.\n\nSo, in decimal form, A ≈ 10.3878 and B ≈ 13."

To do that, I can square both expressions and see which one is larger.

Let's write both:\n\nA^2 = 42 + 2*sqrt(185)\n\nB^2 = 32 + 2*sqrt(252)\n\nSo, the difference between A^2 and B^2 is:\n\nA^2 - B^2 = (42 + 2*sqrt(185)) - (32 + 2*sqrt(252))\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (42 - 32) + 2*(sqrt(185) - sqrt(252))\n\n= 10 + 2*(sqrt(185) - sqrt(252))\n\nSo, if A^2 - B^2 is positive, then A is larger; if it's negative, then B is larger.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(185) and sqrt(252) to figure out the difference.\n\nFirst, sqrt(185):\n\nI know that 13^2 = 169 and 14^2 = 196, so sqrt(185) is between 13 and 14.\n\nLet me compute 13.6^2: 13.6*13.6 = (13 + 0.6)^2 = 13^2 + 2*13*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 169 + 15.6 + 0.36 = 184.96\n\nWow, that's really close to 185. So, sqrt(185) is approximately 13.6.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(252):\n\n252 is between 15^2 = 225 and 16^2 = 256.\n\nSo, sqrt(252) is between 15 and 16. Let's compute 15.5^2: 15.5*15.5 = (15 + 0.5)^2 = 15^2 + 2*15*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 225 + 15 + 0.25 = 240.25\n\nThat's still less than 252. Let's try 15.6:\n\n15.6^2 = (15 + 0.6)^2 = 15^2 + 2*15*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 225 + 18 + 0.36 = 243.36\n\nStill less than 252. Next, 15.7^2 = ?\n\n15.7^2 = (15 + 0.7)^2 = 15^2 + 2*15*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 225 + 21 + 0.49 = 246.49\n\nStill less than 252. Next, 15.8^2:\n\n15.8^2 = (15 + 0.8)^2 = 15^2 + 2*15*0.8 + 0.8^2 = 225 + 24 + 0.64 = 250.64\n\nAh, that's pretty close to 252. So, sqrt(252) is approximately 15.8 + (252 - 250.64)/(2*15.8 + 0.8^2) ?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to just estimate it as 15.85 or something. Alternatively, since 15.8^2 = 250.64, and 15.85^2:\n\n15.85^2 = (15 + 0.85)^2 = 15^2 + 2*15*0.85 + 0.85^2 = 225 + 25.5 + 0.7225 = 251.2225\n\nStill less than 252. Then, 15.85^2 = 251.2225\n\nSo, 252 - 251.2225 = 0.7775\n\nSo, sqrt(252) ≈ 15.85 + 0.7775/(2*15.85)\n\nWhich is approximately 15.85 + 0.7775/31.7 ≈ 15.85 + 0.0246 ≈ 15.8746\n\nSo, sqrt(252) ≈ 15.8746\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(185) ≈ 13.6, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, sqrt(185) ≈ 13.6\n\nsqrt(252) ≈ 15.8746\n\nSo, the difference sqrt(185) - sqrt(252) ≈ 13.6 - 15.8746 ≈ -2.2746\n\nTherefore, A^2 - B^2 ≈ 10 + 2*(-2.2746) ≈ 10 - 4.5492 ≈ 5.4508\n\nWhich is positive. So, A^2 - B^2 ≈ 5.45, which is positive. Therefore, A^2 > B^2, which implies that A > B.\n\nSo, sqrt(5) + sqrt(37) is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(18).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit counterintuitive. I mean, sqrt(37) is bigger than sqrt(18) and sqrt(5) is smaller than sqrt(14). Hmm, so it's not immediately obvious which one is larger.\n\nBut according to my squared values, sqrt(5) + sqrt(37)"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to compare sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(5) + sqrt(21). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that sqrt(1) is just 1, and sqrt(49) is 7. So, if I add those together, it's 1 + 7 = 8. That was straightforward. Now, the other expression is sqrt(5) + sqrt(21). I don't remember the exact values of these square roots off the top of my head, so maybe I can approximate them or find a way to compare them without calculating the exact decimal values.\n\nLet me recall that sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236 and sqrt(21) is approximately 4.583. So, if I add those together, 2.236 + 4.583, that gives me roughly 6.819. Comparing that to the 8 from the first expression, it seems like 8 is larger. But wait, maybe I should check my approximations to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions to see which one is larger without having to calculate the square roots precisely. Let me try that.\n\nFor the first expression, sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) = 1 + 7 = 8. If I square this, I get 8^2 = 64.\n\nFor the second expression, sqrt(5) + sqrt(21). Let me square that: (sqrt(5) + sqrt(21))^2 = (sqrt(5))^2 + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(21) + (sqrt(21))^2. Calculating each term:\n\n- (sqrt(5))^2 = 5\n- (sqrt(21))^2 = 21\n- The middle term is 2*sqrt(5*21) = 2*sqrt(105). Now, sqrt(105) is approximately 10.246, so 2*10.246 is approximately 20.492.\n\nAdding those together: 5 + 20.492 + 21 = 46.492. Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense because 5 + 21 is 26, and 20.492 is added, so 26 + 20.492 is actually 46.492. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion where I thought the squared value was 6.819^2, which is around 46.505. Hmm, okay, so both squared values are approximately 46.5, but one is exactly 64 and the other is approximately 46.5. So, since 64 > 46.5, that means the original expression sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(21).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, for the first one, sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) is 1 + 7 = 8, squared is 64. For the second one, I squared it and got 5 + 21 + 2*sqrt(105), which is 26 + ~20.492, so 46.492. So, yeah, 64 is greater than 46.492, so the first expression is larger.\n\nJust to verify, maybe I can compute sqrt(5) + sqrt(21) more accurately. Let me get better approximations for the square roots.\n\nCalculating sqrt(5): I know that 2^2 is 4, and 3^2 is 9. So sqrt(5) is between 2 and 3. Let me try 2.236^2: 2.236*2.236. Let's compute 2.236*2 = 4.472, 2.236*0.236 is approximately 0.527. So adding them together, 4.472 + 0.527 is about 5. So, 2.236^2 is approximately 5. Similarly, 2.236*2.236 is exactly 5, so that's a good approximation. So, sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236.\n\nNow, sqrt(21): Hmm, 4^2 is 16, 5^2 is 25. So sqrt(21) is between 4 and 5. Let's try 4.5^2: 4.5*4.5 = 20.25. Close to 21. So, 4.5^2 = 20.25, so 4.5 is a bit low. Let me try 4.58^2:\n\n4.58 * 4.58. Let's compute 4*4=16, 4*0.58=2.32, 0.58*4=2.32, and 0.58*0.58=0.3364. Adding those together: 16 + 2.32 + 2.32 + 0.3364 = 21. So, 4.58^2 is exactly 21. So, sqrt(21) ≈ 4.58.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(5) + sqrt(21) ≈ 2.236 + 4.58 = 6.816.\n\nCompare that to sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) = 8. So yes, 8 is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something else, but for just two terms, I think squaring the sum is a straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of distances on the number line. sqrt(1) is 1, sqrt(49) is 7, so they are pretty far apart. On the other hand, sqrt(5) is about 2.236, which is between 2 and 3, and sqrt(21) is about 4.58, between 4 and 5. So, adding them together, we get one number in the 1-7 range and another in the 2-5 range, but the 1-7 sum is 8, which is much larger.\n\nWait, actually, when you add sqrt(5) and sqrt(21), you get roughly 6.8, while sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) is 8. So, yes, 8 is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can visualize this on a number line. Let's plot sqrt(1) at 1, sqrt(49) at 7, so their sum is at 8. Then sqrt(5) is around 2.236, and sqrt(21) is around 4.58, so adding those together is about 6.8, which is less than 8. So, again, 8 is larger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the difference between the two sums. Let me denote A = sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) = 8, and B = sqrt(5) + sqrt(21) ≈ 6.816. Then, the difference A - B ≈ 8 - 6.816 = 1.184, which is positive, so A is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if I have a more precise calculation for B, maybe I can get a better approximation.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(5) + sqrt(21) more accurately.\n\nFirst, sqrt(5) is approximately 2.2360679775, and sqrt(21) is approximately 4.583666.

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(4) + sqrt(45) and sqrt(30) + sqrt(34). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can calculate each sum numerically and then compare them? That sounds straightforward.\n\nFirst, let's compute sqrt(4). That's easy, it's just 2. Now, sqrt(45)... I know that 45 is 9 times 5, so sqrt(45) should be sqrt(9*5) which is sqrt(9)*sqrt(5). That's 3*sqrt(5). Hmm, but I don't know the exact value of sqrt(5), though I know it's approximately 2.236. So, 3*2.236 is about 6.708. So, sqrt(45) is approximately 6.708.\n\nAdding that to sqrt(4), which is 2, we get 2 + 6.708 = 8.708. So, the first sum is approximately 8.708.\n\nNow, let's compute the second sum: sqrt(30) + sqrt(34). I'll need to approximate these values. Starting with sqrt(30). I know that 5^2 is 25 and 6^2 is 36, so sqrt(30) is somewhere between 5 and 6. Let me think, 5.5^2 is 30.25, which is very close to 30. So, sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477.\n\nNext, sqrt(34). Similarly, 5^2 is 25, 6^2 is 36, so sqrt(34) is between 5 and 6. Let's see, 5.8^2 is 33.64, which is a bit less than 34. 5.9^2 is 34.81, which is a bit more than 34. So sqrt(34) is between 5.8 and 5.9. Let me approximate it as 5.830.\n\nAdding those together: 5.477 + 5.830 = 11.307. So, the second sum is approximately 11.307.\n\nComparing the two sums: 8.708 vs. 11.307. Clearly, 11.307 is larger than 8.708. So, sqrt(30) + sqrt(34) is larger.\n\nBut wait, the question asks to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, I guess I need to confirm that my approximations are accurate enough. Maybe I should try to compute the sums more precisely or use a different method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions to compare them without having to take square roots. That might be a better approach because squaring can sometimes give a clearer comparison.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(45) and B = sqrt(30) + sqrt(34). I need to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square both A and B, I can compare A^2 and B^2, which might be easier.\n\nSo, let's compute A^2: (sqrt(4) + sqrt(45))^2 = (sqrt(4))^2 + 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(45) + (sqrt(45))^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(4))^2 = 4.\n\n2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(45) = 2*2*sqrt(45) = 4*sqrt(45). Hmm, sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5), so 4*3*sqrt(5) = 12*sqrt(5).\n\n(sqrt(45))^2 = 45.\n\nSo, A^2 = 4 + 12*sqrt(5) + 45 = 49 + 12*sqrt(5).\n\nSimilarly, compute B^2: (sqrt(30) + sqrt(34))^2 = (sqrt(30))^2 + 2*sqrt(30)*sqrt(34) + (sqrt(34))^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(30))^2 = 30.\n\n2*sqrt(30)*sqrt(34) = 2*sqrt(1020). Hmm, sqrt(1020) is a bit complicated. Maybe I can leave it as 2*sqrt(1020) for now.\n\n(sqrt(34))^2 = 34.\n\nSo, B^2 = 30 + 2*sqrt(1020) + 34 = 64 + 2*sqrt(1020).\n\nNow, we need to compare A^2 and B^2, which are 49 + 12*sqrt(5) and 64 + 2*sqrt(1020).\n\nHmm, so 49 vs. 64: 64 is larger, but we have to consider the other terms as well. The terms with square roots complicate things.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute the numerical values of A^2 and B^2 to see which is larger.\n\nFirst, let's compute 49 + 12*sqrt(5):\n\nsqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so 12*2.236 ≈ 26.832. Adding 49 gives 49 + 26.832 ≈ 75.832.\n\nNow, compute 64 + 2*sqrt(1020):\n\nsqrt(1020) is approximately sqrt(1024) which is 32, so sqrt(1020) is a bit less, maybe 31.96. Let me check:\n\n31^2 = 961, 32^2 = 1024, so sqrt(1020) is 32 - (1024 - 1020)/(2*32) = 32 - 4/64 = 32 - 0.0625 = 31.9375. So, approximately 31.9375.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(1020) ≈ 2*31.9375 ≈ 63.875. Adding 64 gives 64 + 63.875 ≈ 127.875.\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 75.832 and B^2 ≈ 127.875. Clearly, B^2 is much larger than A^2.\n\nTherefore, B = sqrt(30) + sqrt(34) is larger than A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(45).\n\nSo, the larger number is sqrt(30) + sqrt(34), which should be written in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Therefore, a = 30 and b = 34.\n\nHence, the answer is sqrt(30) + sqrt(34).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me cross-verify by calculating the decimal values more precisely.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(45) = 2 + sqrt(45). sqrt(45) is approximately 6.7082039325. So, A ≈ 2 + 6.7082039325 ≈ 8.7082039325.\n\nCompute B = sqrt(30) + sqrt(34). sqrt(30) is approximately 5.47722557505. sqrt(34) is approximately 5.83095189485. Adding them together: 5.47722557505 + 5.83095189485 ≈ 11.3081774699.\n\nSo, A ≈ 8.7082 and B ≈ 11.3082. So, B is indeed larger.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that sqrt(30) + sqrt(34) is larger.

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they aren't linear functions. So, I can't just compare the radicands (the numbers under the square roots) directly. I need another method. Maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare. That sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me denote the first expression as A = sqrt(12) + sqrt(30) and the second expression as B = sqrt(18) + sqrt(28). So, I need to compare A and B. To do that, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and see which one is larger. If A^2 > B^2, then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nCalculating A^2: (sqrt(12) + sqrt(30))^2. I remember that (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2. So, applying that here:\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(12))^2 + 2*sqrt(12)*sqrt(30) + (sqrt(30))^2\n     = 12 + 2*sqrt(12*30) + 30\n     = 12 + 2*sqrt(360) + 30\n     = 42 + 2*sqrt(360)\n\nSimilarly, calculating B^2: (sqrt(18) + sqrt(28))^2.\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(18))^2 + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))^2\n     = 18 + 2*sqrt(18*28) + 28\n     = 18 + 2*sqrt(504) + 28\n     = 46 + 2*sqrt(504)\n\nNow, I need to compare A^2 = 42 + 2*sqrt(360) and B^2 = 46 + 2*sqrt(504).\n\nHmm, okay, let me compute the numerical values of these to see which one is larger. Let's start with sqrt(360). I know that sqrt(361) is 19, so sqrt(360) is just a bit less than 19. Let's approximate it. Since 19^2 = 361, so 19^2 - 360 = 1, so sqrt(360) ≈ 19 - (1)/(2*19) ≈ 19 - 0.026 ≈ 18.974.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(504). Well, sqrt(484) is 22, sqrt(529) is 23, so sqrt(504) is between 22 and 23. Let me compute 22^2 = 484, 22.5^2 = 506.25. So, sqrt(504) is just a bit less than 22.5. Let's approximate it. 506.25 - 504 = 2.25, so sqrt(504) ≈ 22.5 - (2.25)/(2*22.5) ≈ 22.5 - 0.049 ≈ 22.451.\n\nOkay, so now plug these back into A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 ≈ 42 + 2*18.974 ≈ 42 + 37.948 ≈ 79.948\n\nB^2 ≈ 46 + 2*22.451 ≈ 46 + 44.902 ≈ 90.902\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 79.948 and B^2 ≈ 90.902. Therefore, B^2 is larger than A^2, which means that B is larger than A. So, sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) is larger than sqrt(12) + sqrt(30).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me double-check the approximations.\n\nsqrt(360): Since 19^2 = 361, then sqrt(360) is indeed approximately 18.974. That seems correct.\n\nsqrt(504): As I thought, 22^2 = 484, 22.5^2 = 506.25, so sqrt(504) is 22.5 - (506.25 - 504)/(2*22.5) = 22.5 - 2.25/45 = 22.5 - 0.0499 ≈ 22.4501. So, 22.4501 is accurate.\n\nNow, going back to A^2: 42 + 2*18.974 = 42 + 37.948 = 79.948. That's correct.\n\nB^2: 46 + 2*22.4501 = 46 + 44.9002 = 90.9002. Correct.\n\nTherefore, B^2 > A^2, so B > A.\n\nBut wait, before I conclude, maybe I can try another method to verify. Alternatively, I can compute the difference numerically, maybe with more precise square roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can square both expressions and see the difference. Let me compute A^2 and B^2 more precisely.\n\nCompute sqrt(360) more accurately.\n\nI know that 18.974^2 = (19 - 0.026)^2 = 19^2 - 2*19*0.026 + 0.026^2 = 361 - 0.988 + 0.000676 ≈ 360.012676. So, sqrt(360) ≈ 18.97366596.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(504): 22.4501^2 = (22 + 0.4501)^2 = 22^2 + 2*22*0.4501 + 0.4501^2 = 484 + 19.8044 + 0.20259 ≈ 504.00699. So, sqrt(504) ≈ 22.4501.\n\nSo, now compute A^2: 42 + 2*18.97366596 = 42 + 37.94733192 = 79.94733192.\n\nB^2: 46 + 2*22.4501 = 46 + 44.9002 = 90.9002.\n\nTherefore, as before, A^2 ≈ 79.9473 and B^2 ≈ 90.9002.\n\nSo, B^2 is definitely larger, so B > A.\n\nSo, sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) is larger.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute the actual numerical values of A and B.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(12) + sqrt(30). sqrt(12) is approximately 3.4641, sqrt(30) is approximately 5.4772. So, A ≈ 3.4641 + 5.4772 ≈ 8.9413.\n\nCompute B = sqrt(18) + sqrt(28). sqrt(18) is approximately 4.2426, sqrt(28) is approximately 5.2915. So, B ≈ 4.2426 + 5.2915 ≈ 9.5341.\n\nSo, comparing 8.9413 and 9.5341, clearly B is larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(18) + sqrt(28) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a way to compare sqrt(12)+sqrt(30) and sqrt(18)+sqrt(28) without squaring. Maybe by comparing their individual square roots.\n\nBut I don't think that's straightforward because the sum of square roots isn't just the sum of their individual square roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can manipulate the expressions to see if I can express them in a form where I can"

If A squared is larger, then A is larger; if B squared is larger, then B is larger. So let's see.\n\nFirst, note that sqrt(910) is definitely larger than sqrt(76). Therefore, 2*sqrt(910) is larger than 2*sqrt(76). But the other parts are 40 vs. 61. 40 is less than 61, so which effect is stronger?\n\nThis is a classic comparison of which of two numbers is larger: 40 + something vs. 61 + something else. Here, the \"something\" is 2*sqrt(76) for A, and 2*sqrt(910) for B.\n\nI think the key is to compute the difference between A squared and B squared and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nLet me compute the difference: B squared - A squared.\n\nThat would be (61 + 2*sqrt(910)) - (40 + 2*sqrt(76)) = 21 + 2*(sqrt(910) - sqrt(76))\n\nSo, the difference is 21 + 2*(sqrt(910) - sqrt(76))\n\nNow, sqrt(910) is a number. Let me approximate it. Since 30^2 = 900, so sqrt(900) = 30, sqrt(910) is a bit more than 30. Let me compute sqrt(910):\n\nsqrt(910) ≈ 30.166\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(76): 8^2 = 64, 9^2 = 81, so sqrt(76) is between 8 and 9. Let's approximate:\n\n8^2 = 64, 8.5^2 = 72.25, 8.7^2 = 75.69, 8.72^2 = approx 76. So sqrt(76) ≈ 8.7178\n\nSo sqrt(910) ≈ 30.166, sqrt(76) ≈ 8.7178.\n\nSo the difference sqrt(910) - sqrt(76) ≈ 30.166 - 8.7178 ≈ 21.4482\n\nSo plug that back into the difference:\n\n21 + 2*(21.4482) = 21 + 42.8964 ≈ 63.8964\n\nSo, 63.8964 is positive, which means B squared is larger than A squared. Therefore, B is larger than A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that approximation because it's easy to make a mistake with square roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use more precise approximations.\n\nLet's compute sqrt(76):\n\n76 is between 64 (8^2) and 81 (9^2). Let me compute 8.7^2 = 75.69, which is very close to 76. So, 8.7^2 = 75.69, 8.71^2 = 75.8641, 8.72^2 = 75.9184, 8.73^2 = 76.1129.\n\nWait, 8.73^2 is 76.1129, which is just a bit more than 76. So sqrt(76) is just a little less than 8.73. Let's say approximately 8.725.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(910):\n\n910 is between 900 (30^2) and 961 (31^2). So sqrt(910) is between 30 and 31. Let's compute 30.16^2:\n\n30.16^2: 30^2 = 900, 0.16^2 = 0.0256, cross term 2*30*0.16 = 9.6. So total is 900 + 9.6 + 0.0256 = 909.6256.\n\nThat's very close to 910. So sqrt(910) ≈ 30.16 + (910 - 909.6256)/(2*30.16)\n\nDifference is 0.3744, divided by 60.32 is approximately 0.0062. So sqrt(910) ≈ 30.1662.\n\nSo sqrt(910) ≈ 30.1662, sqrt(76) ≈ 8.725, as above.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(910) - sqrt(76) ≈ 30.1662 - 8.725 ≈ 21.4412.\n\nSo then, 21 + 2*(21.4412) = 21 + 42.8824 ≈ 63.8824.\n\nWhich is positive, so B squared is greater than A squared, so B is greater than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(26) + sqrt(35) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(38).

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that sometimes when comparing square roots, squaring both sides can be helpful because it can eliminate the square roots and make the comparison easier. But I have to be careful because squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, so the inequality direction should stay the same.

Because sqrt(9)*sqrt(10) is sqrt(9*10) = sqrt(90).\n\nAlso, (sqrt(10))² = 10.\n\nSo, B² = 9 + 2*sqrt(90) + 10.\n\nSimplify that:\n\n9 + 10 is 19, so B² = 19 + 2*sqrt(90).\n\nAlright, so now I have both A² and B²:\n\nA² = 31 + 2*sqrt(84).\n\nB² = 19 + 2*sqrt(90).\n\nTo compare A² and B², let's see which is bigger. Let's compute the difference between A² and B²:\n\nA² - B² = (31 + 2*sqrt(84)) - (19 + 2*sqrt(90)).\n\nSimplify:\n\n31 - 19 is 12, and 2*sqrt(84) - 2*sqrt(90) is 2*(sqrt(84) - sqrt(90)).\n\nSo, A² - B² = 12 + 2*(sqrt(84) - sqrt(90)).\n\nHmm, okay. Let's compute sqrt(84) and sqrt(90) approximately to see what's going on here.\n\nI know that sqrt(81) is 9, so sqrt(84) is a bit more than 9, maybe around 9.165.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(100) is 10, so sqrt(90) is a bit less than 10, maybe around 9.4868.\n\nSo, sqrt(84) ≈ 9.165 and sqrt(90) ≈ 9.4868.\n\nSo, sqrt(84) - sqrt(90) ≈ 9.165 - 9.4868 ≈ -0.3218.\n\nThus, 2*(sqrt(84) - sqrt(90)) ≈ 2*(-0.3218) ≈ -0.6436.\n\nSo, A² - B² ≈ 12 + (-0.6436) ≈ 11.3564.\n\nWhich is positive, so A² > B².\n\nTherefore, since A² > B² and the square function is increasing for non-negative numbers, that means A > B.\n\nSo, sqrt(3) + sqrt(28) is larger than sqrt(9) + sqrt(10).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations, let me verify.\n\nCompute sqrt(84): 84 is 9*9.333, so yes, sqrt(84) is about 9.165.\n\nsqrt(90): 9*10, so sqrt(90) is about 9.4868.\n\nSo, sqrt(84) - sqrt(90) is indeed negative, and the difference is about -0.3218.\n\nMultiply by 2: -0.6436.\n\nAdd 12: 11.3564, which is positive.\n\nSo, yes, A² is greater than B².\n\nTherefore, sqrt(3) + sqrt(28) is larger.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the actual decimal values to see the difference.\n\nCompute A: sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915. So, A ≈ 1.732 + 5.2915 ≈ 7.0235.\n\nCompute B: sqrt(9) = 3, sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623. So, B ≈ 3 + 3.1623 ≈ 6.1623.\n\nSo, 7.0235 vs 6.1623: 7.0235 is clearly larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(3) + sqrt(28) is larger.\n\nSo, the answer should be sqrt(3) + sqrt(28), which is already in the desired form.\n\nWait, but just to follow the problem statement, it says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\" So, I just need to present it as sqrt(3) + sqrt(28). But let me think, is there a way to perhaps combine or represent it differently? Hmm, not that I can think of.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial squaring, but let me cross-verify.\n\nCompute A²:\n\n(sqrt(3) + sqrt(28))² = 3 + 2*sqrt(84) + 28 = 31 + 2*sqrt(84). Correct.\n\nCompute B²:\n\n(sqrt(9) + sqrt(10))² = 9 + 2*sqrt(90) + 10 = 19 + 2*sqrt(90). Correct.\n\nSo, A² - B² = 12 + 2*(sqrt(84) - sqrt(90)). Correct.\n\nAnd as sqrt(84) ≈ 9.165, sqrt(90) ≈ 9.4868, so sqrt(84) - sqrt(90) ≈ -0.3218, so 2*(-0.3218) ≈ -0.6436. Then, 12 - 0.6436 ≈ 11.3564. Positive, so A² > B², so A > B.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't square both sides, could I compare them term by term?\n\nLet me think: sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623.\n\nSo, sqrt(3) + sqrt(10) ≈ 4.8943.\n\nWhereas sqrt(9) + sqrt(28) = 3 + 5.2915 ≈ 8.2915.\n\nWait, but that's not comparing the same terms. Wait, the original problem is sqrt(3) + sqrt(28) vs sqrt(9) + sqrt(10). So, it's not just adding the sqrt(3) vs sqrt(9), etc.\n\nWait, so another approach: Since sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915, their sum is approximately 7.0235.\n\nWhereas sqrt(9) is 3"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(18) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(25) + sqrt(30). Hmm, let me start by calculating each square root separately to see what they come out to. \n\nFirst, sqrt(25) is straightforward because 25 is a perfect square. So sqrt(25) is 5. That part is easy. Now, what about sqrt(30)? I know that 25 is 5 squared and 36 is 6 squared, so sqrt(30) must be somewhere between 5 and 6. Let me calculate it more precisely. \n\nI remember that sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477 because 5.477 squared is roughly 30. Let me double-check that: 5.477 * 5.477. Let me compute 5 * 5 which is 25, 5 * 0.477 is approximately 2.385, 0.477 * 5 is another 2.385, and 0.477 * 0.477 is about 0.227. Adding all these together: 25 + 2.385 + 2.385 + 0.227, which totals approximately 30. So, yeah, sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477.\n\nMoving on to sqrt(41). Similarly, 36 is 6 squared and 49 is 7 squared, so sqrt(41) is between 6 and 7. Let me calculate it more accurately. 6.4 squared is 40.96, which is very close to 41. So, sqrt(41) is approximately 6.4. Let me confirm that: 6.4 * 6.4 is indeed 40.96, which is just barely less than 41, so a bit more than 6.4. Maybe 6.4025? Well, for now, I'll just note that sqrt(41) is approximately 6.403.\n\nNow, let me sum up the square roots. \n\nFirst, sqrt(18) + sqrt(41). I need to calculate sqrt(18). 16 is 4 squared, 25 is 5 squared, so sqrt(18) is between 4 and 5. Let me compute it more precisely. 4.2 squared is 17.64, 4.3 squared is 18.49. So, sqrt(18) is between 4.2 and 4.3. Since 4.2 squared is 17.64 and 17.64 + 0.85 is 18.49, so sqrt(18) is approximately 4.2426. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 4.2 squared is 17.64, 4.24 squared is 17.9776, 4.25 squared is 18.0625. So, sqrt(18) is approximately 4.2426 because 4.2426 squared is 18. So, let me note that down: sqrt(18) ≈ 4.2426.\n\nSo, sqrt(18) + sqrt(41) is approximately 4.2426 + 6.403, which is 10.6456. \n\nNow, sqrt(25) + sqrt(30) is 5 + 5.477, which is 10.477. \n\nComparing the two sums: 10.6456 versus 10.477. So, 10.6456 is larger. Therefore, sqrt(18) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(25) + sqrt(30). \n\nWait, let me see if I did that correctly. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, sqrt(18) is approximately 4.2426. sqrt(41) is approximately 6.4031. Adding them together: 4.2426 + 6.4031. Let me add the decimal parts: 0.2426 + 0.4031 = 0.6457. Then, add the whole numbers: 4 + 6 = 10. So, total is 10.6457. Correct.\n\nNow, sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(30) is approximately 5.4772. Adding them together: 5 + 5.4772 = 10.4772. \n\nSo, indeed, 10.6457 is larger than 10.4772. Therefore, sqrt(18) + sqrt(41) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem without calculating the approximate decimal values. Let me think.\n\nI can consider each pair of square roots separately and compare them. For example, sqrt(18) vs sqrt(25) and sqrt(41) vs sqrt(30). But actually, sqrt(18) is less than sqrt(25), and sqrt(41) is more than sqrt(30). So, comparing the two sums, it's not just a simple comparison between pairs. Instead, I have to consider how much each is more or less.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) is an increasing function. That is, if a and b are larger, their square roots are larger. But in this case, sqrt(18) is smaller than sqrt(25), but sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(30). So, which effect is stronger?\n\nAlternatively, I can square both expressions to compare them. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(18) + sqrt(41) and B = sqrt(25) + sqrt(30).\n\nCompute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(18) + sqrt(41))^2 = 18 + 2*sqrt(18*41) + 41 = 59 + 2*sqrt(738).\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(25) + sqrt(30))^2 = 25 + 2*sqrt(25*30) + 30 = 55 + 2*sqrt(750).\n\nNow, compute A^2 - B^2: (59 + 2*sqrt(738)) - (55 + 2*sqrt(750)) = 4 + 2*(sqrt(738) - sqrt(750)).\n\nNow, compute sqrt(738) and sqrt(750). \n\nI know that sqrt(729) is 27, since 27^2=729. So, sqrt(738) is slightly more than 27. Let me compute sqrt(738) - 27.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(750) is just a bit more than sqrt(729)=27 as well. Let me compute sqrt(750)-27.\n\nSo, sqrt(738) = 27 + x, and sqrt(750) = 27 + y, where x and y are small positive numbers.\n\nCompute (27 + x)^2 = 738 and (27 + y)^2 = 750.\n\nExpanding: 27^2 + 54x + x^2 = 738, so 729 + 54x + x^2 = 738. Therefore, 54x + x^2 = 9. Since x is small, x^2 is negligible, so approximately 54x ≈ 9, so x ≈ 9/54 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667. So, sqrt(738) ≈ 27 + 0.1667 ≈ 27.1667.\n\nSimilarly, for sqrt(750): (27 + y)^2 = 750. So, 729 + 54y + y^2 = 750. So, 54y + y^2 = 21. Again, y is small, so y^2 is negligible, so 54y ≈ 21, so y ≈ 21/54 ≈ 0.3889. So, sqrt(750) ≈ 27 + 0.3889 ≈ 27.3889.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(738) - sqrt(750) ≈ 27.1667 - 27.3889 ≈ -0.2222.\n\nSo, going back to A^2 - B^2: 4 + 2*(-0.222"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(5) + sqrt(46) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(37) or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that sometimes when comparing sums of square roots, squaring both sides can help eliminate the square roots, which might make it easier to compare the two. But I have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, but in this case, since both sides are positive, squaring should be safe.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(46) and B = sqrt(13) + sqrt(37). I need to compare A and B. If I square both A and B, I can compare A² and B² instead.\n\nCalculating A²: (sqrt(5) + sqrt(46))² = (sqrt(5))² + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(46) + (sqrt(46))² = 5 + 2*sqrt(230) + 46 = 51 + 2*sqrt(230).\n\nCalculating B²: (sqrt(13) + sqrt(37))² = (sqrt(13))² + 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(37) + (sqrt(37))² = 13 + 2*sqrt(481) + 37 = 50 + 2*sqrt(481).\n\nNow, I have to compare A² and B², which are 51 + 2*sqrt(230) and 50 + 2*sqrt(481). It's easier if the numbers are on the same side, so perhaps I can subtract 50 from both to get 1 + 2*sqrt(230) and 2*sqrt(481). Hmm, but that might not be the most straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can subtract the smaller numbers. Let's see: A² - B² = (51 + 2*sqrt(230)) - (50 + 2*sqrt(481)) = 1 + 2*sqrt(230) - 2*sqrt(481). If this is positive, then A² > B², meaning A > B; if it's negative, then A < B.\n\nSo, let's compute A² - B²: 1 + 2*sqrt(230) - 2*sqrt(481). Let's factor out the 2: 1 + 2*(sqrt(230) - sqrt(481)). I need to figure out whether sqrt(230) is larger than sqrt(481). Well, 230 is less than 481, so sqrt(230) is less than sqrt(481). Therefore, sqrt(230) - sqrt(481) is negative. Multiplying by 2, it remains negative. So, 1 + 2*(negative number). Hmm, is this positive or negative?\n\nWait, 1 is just a small positive number, but 2*(sqrt(230) - sqrt(481)) is negative because sqrt(230) < sqrt(481). So, 1 + (negative number). So, is the entire expression positive or negative? It depends on how much sqrt(230) is less than sqrt(481). Let me approximate the values.\n\nCalculating sqrt(230): sqrt(225) = 15, so sqrt(230) is a bit more than 15. Let me approximate. 15² = 225, 15.2² = 231.04. So, sqrt(230) is approx 15.16.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(481): since 21² = 441, 22² = 484. So, sqrt(481) is just a bit less than 22. Let's approximate: 21.94² ≈ 481 (because 21.94² = (22 - 0.06)² = 22² - 2*22*0.06 + 0.06² = 484 - 2.64 + 0.0036 ≈ 481.3636). So, sqrt(481) is approximately 21.94.\n\nSo, sqrt(230) ≈ 15.16, sqrt(481) ≈ 21.94. Therefore, sqrt(230) - sqrt(481) ≈ 15.16 - 21.94 = -6.78. Multiply by 2: -13.56. Then add 1: 1 - 13.56 = -12.56. So, A² - B² ≈ -12.56, which is negative. Therefore, A² < B², so A < B.\n\nWait, that seems counterintuitive because sqrt(5) is small and sqrt(46) is a bit larger, while sqrt(13) and sqrt(37) are both in the mid to high numbers. But according to this, B is larger? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nCalculating sqrt(230): 15.16, that seems right because 15² = 225 and 15.16² is roughly 230. Similarly, sqrt(481) is approximately 21.94, correct as 21.94² ≈ 481. So, sqrt(230) - sqrt(481) ≈ -6.78, so 2*(sqrt(230) - sqrt(481)) ≈ -13.56, plus 1 is -12.56. So, A² - B² ≈ -12.56, meaning A² < B², so A < B. Therefore, sqrt(5) + sqrt(46) ≈ B, so B is larger.\n\nWait, but maybe my approximation is off. Let me try a better approximation.\n\nCalculating sqrt(230): Let's use linear approximation. Let f(x) = sqrt(x). Let x = 225, f(x) = 15. Let delta_x = 5. Then f(x + delta_x) ≈ f(x) + f'(x)*delta_x. f'(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)). So, f'(225) = 1/(2*15) = 1/30 ≈ 0.0333. So, f(230) ≈ 15 + 0.0333*5 ≈ 15 + 0.1665 ≈ 15.1665. So, sqrt(230) ≈ 15.1665.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(481): Let x = 484, f(x) = 22. Let delta_x = -3. Then f(x + delta_x) ≈ 22 + f'(484)*(-3). f'(484) = 1/(2*22) = 1/44 ≈ 0.0227. So, f(481) ≈ 22 + 0.0227*(-3) ≈ 22 - 0.0681 ≈ 21.9319.\n\nSo, sqrt(230) ≈ 15.1665, sqrt(481) ≈ 21.9319. Therefore, sqrt(230) - sqrt(481) ≈ 15.1665 - 21.9319 ≈ -6.7654. Multiply by 2: -13.5308. Add 1: -12.5308. So, A² - B² ≈ -12.5308, which is approximately -12.53. So, A² < B², so A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(5) + sqrt(46) is smaller than sqrt(13) + sqrt(37). So, sqrt(13) + sqrt(37) is larger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the actual values:\n\nCompute sqrt(5): approx 2.23607\n\nsqrt(46): approx 6.78233\n\nSo, A ≈ 2.23607 + 6.78233 ≈ 9.0184\n\nCompute sqrt(13): approx 3.60555\n\nsqrt(37): approx 6.08276\n\nSo, B ≈ 3.60555 + 6.08276 ≈ 9.68831\n\nSo, A ≈"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem: I need to compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(40) and sqrt(30) + sqrt(37). Hmm, okay. I want to figure out which one is larger. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare since squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers. That way, if I can compare the squares, I can determine which original expression is larger.\n\nFirst, let me denote A = sqrt(7) + sqrt(40) and B = sqrt(30) + sqrt(37). So, I need to compare A and B. Let me compute A² and B².\n\nCalculating A²: (sqrt(7) + sqrt(40))². I know that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So, this becomes 7 + 2*sqrt(7*40) + 40. Let me compute each part:\n\n7 + 40 is 47. Then, 2*sqrt(7*40). Let me compute 7*40 first: that's 280. So, 2*sqrt(280). Hmm, sqrt(280) can be simplified. Since 280 = 4*70, so sqrt(280) = sqrt(4*70) = 2*sqrt(70). Therefore, 2*sqrt(280) = 2*(2*sqrt(70)) = 4*sqrt(70). So, A² = 47 + 4*sqrt(70).\n\nNow, calculating B²: (sqrt(30) + sqrt(37))². Again, using the formula, (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So, this becomes 30 + 2*sqrt(30*37) + 37. Let's compute each part:\n\n30 + 37 is 67. Then, 2*sqrt(30*37). Let me compute 30*37: 30*30 is 900, plus 30*7 is 210, so 900 + 210 is 1110. So, 2*sqrt(1110). Hmm, sqrt(1110) can't be simplified further because 1110 is 10*111, and 111 is 3*37, so prime factors are 2*3*5*37. So, sqrt(1110) is irrational, approximately, but let me note that as 2*sqrt(1110).\n\nSo, B² = 67 + 2*sqrt(1110).\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B², which are 47 + 4*sqrt(70) and 67 + 2*sqrt(1110). Hmm, okay, but which one is larger? Let me see.\n\nFirst, 47 vs. 67: so A² is 47 and B² is 67. So, B² is larger at this point. But wait, hold on, that might not be the case because A² and B² both have those square roots multiplied by other numbers.\n\nSo, let me think. Maybe I can subtract A² from B² and see if that difference is positive or negative.\n\nSo, compute B² - A²: (67 + 2*sqrt(1110)) - (47 + 4*sqrt(70)).\n\nSimplify: 67 - 47 is 20, and 2*sqrt(1110) - 4*sqrt(70) is the other part.\n\nSo, 20 + (2*sqrt(1110) - 4*sqrt(70)). Hmm, let me factor out a 2: 20 + 2*(sqrt(1110) - 2*sqrt(70)).\n\nSo, the question now is whether sqrt(1110) - 2*sqrt(70) is positive or negative. If it is negative, then B² - A² is 20 + 2*(negative number), which would be less than 20, but whether it's positive or negative depends on the magnitude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approximate sqrt(70) and sqrt(1110) to get a sense.\n\nI know that sqrt(64) is 8, sqrt(81) is 9, so sqrt(70) is between 8 and 9. Let me approximate it.\n\nCompute 8.3²: 8² is 64, 0.3² is 0.09, and cross term is 2*8*0.3=4.8. So, 8.3² = 64 + 4.8 + 0.09 = 68.89. Hmm, 8.3² is 68.89, which is less than 70.\n\nCompute 8.4²: 8² is 64, 0.4² is 0.16, cross term 2*8*0.4=6.4. So, 64 + 6.4 + 0.16 = 70.56. So, 8.4² is 70.56, which is slightly more than 70.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(70) is between 8.3 and 8.4. Let me compute 8.35²: 8.35² = (8.3 + 0.05)² = 8.3² + 2*8.3*0.05 + 0.05² = 68.89 + 0.83 + 0.0025 = 69.7225, which is still less than 70.\n\nThen, 8.375²: 8.375 is midway between 8.3 and 8.4. Let me compute 8.375²:\n\nCompute 8.375²: (8 + 0.375)² = 64 + 2*8*0.375 + 0.375². 2*8*0.375 is 6, and 0.375² is 0.140625. So, 64 + 6 = 70, plus 0.140625 is 70.140625. So, 8.375² is approximately 70.140625, which is just over 70.\n\nSo, sqrt(70) is between 8.375 and 8.375² is 70.1406, which is just a bit over 70. So, sqrt(70) ≈ 8.366 or something. Let me just take it as approximately 8.366.\n\nSimilarly, compute sqrt(1110). Hmm, 33² is 1089, 34² is 1156. So, sqrt(1110) is between 33 and 34. Let's approximate it.\n\nCompute 33.3²: 33² is 1089, 0.3² is 0.09, and cross term is 2*33*0.3 = 19.8. So, 1089 + 19.8 + 0.09 = 1108.89. Hmm, 33.3² is 1108.89, which is less than 1110.\n\nCompute 33.4²: 33² is 1089, 0.4² is 0.16, cross term is 2*33*0.4 = 26.4. So, 1089 + 26.4 + 0.16 = 1115.56. So, 33.4² is 1115.56, which is more than 1110.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1110) is between 33.3 and 33.4. Let's compute 33.35²:\n\n33.35²: 33² is 1089, 0.35² is 0.1225, cross term is 2*33*0.35 = 23.1. So, 1089 + 23.1 + 0.1225 = 1112.2225. Hmm, 33.35² is 1112.2225, which is more than 1110.\n\nCompute 33.3² is 1108.89, which is less than 111"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(14) + sqrt(46) and sqrt(19) + sqrt(39). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have to figure out whether sqrt(14) + sqrt(46) is larger than sqrt(19) + sqrt(39), or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that sometimes comparing square roots can be tricky because they don't always behave the same way when you add them. Maybe I should square both expressions to make them easier to compare. That sounds like a plan.\n\nFirst, let me denote:\nA = sqrt(14) + sqrt(46)\nB = sqrt(19) + sqrt(39)\n\nI need to compare A and B. To make this comparison, I can square both A and B separately and then compare the results. Let me compute A squared and B squared.\n\nStarting with A squared:\nA² = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(46))²\nUsing the formula (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y², so:\nA² = (sqrt(14))² + 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(46) + (sqrt(46))²\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(14))² = 14\n(sqrt(46))² = 46\nAnd the middle term is 2*sqrt(14*46). Let me compute 14*46 first. 14*40 is 560, and 14*6 is 84, so 560 + 84 = 644. So sqrt(644) is the middle term.\n\nTherefore, A² = 14 + 2*sqrt(644) + 46. Adding 14 and 46 gives 60, so A² = 60 + 2*sqrt(644). Got that.\n\nNow, doing the same for B squared:\nB² = (sqrt(19) + sqrt(39))²\nAgain, using (x + y)² formula:\nB² = (sqrt(19))² + 2*sqrt(19)*sqrt(39) + (sqrt(39))²\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(19))² = 19\n(sqrt(39))² = 39\nMiddle term is 2*sqrt(19*39). Let's compute 19*39. 20*39 is 780, minus 1*39 is 39, so 780 - 39 = 741. Therefore, the middle term is 2*sqrt(741).\n\nThus, B² = 19 + 2*sqrt(741) + 39. Adding 19 and 39 gives 58, so B² = 58 + 2*sqrt(741).\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B². But both A² and B² have an integer part (60 and 58 respectively) and a square root term (2*sqrt(644) and 2*sqrt(741)). Since 60 > 58, A² is larger than B². Wait, does that mean A is larger than B? Hmm, not necessarily. Because even though A² is larger, the difference might be too small to be noticed just by squaring.\n\nBut maybe I can compute the exact difference between A² and B² to see if it's positive or negative. Let me compute A² - B²:\n\nA² - B² = (60 + 2*sqrt(644)) - (58 + 2*sqrt(741)) = (60 - 58) + 2*sqrt(644) - 2*sqrt(741) = 2 + 2*(sqrt(644) - sqrt(741))\n\nSo, I have A² - B² = 2 + 2*(sqrt(644) - sqrt(741)). Since sqrt(644) is less than sqrt(741), this difference will be negative. So, A² - B² is less than zero, which means A² < B². Therefore, A < B.\n\nWait a second, so that would mean sqrt(14) + sqrt(46) is less than sqrt(19) + sqrt(39). So, sqrt(19) + sqrt(39) is larger. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(19) + sqrt(39). But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you square, you might introduce errors.\n\nLet me compute A² again:\nsqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417, sqrt(46) ≈ 6.7823. Adding those gives ≈10.524. Squaring that gives ≈110.76.\n\nSimilarly, B²:\nsqrt(19) ≈4.3589, sqrt(39)≈6.2449. Adding gives ≈10.6038. Squaring that gives ≈112.468.\n\nComparing 110.76 and 112.468, yes, 112.468 is larger, so B² is larger. Therefore, B is larger than A, which confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether the differences in the square roots result in a bigger increase when squared. For example, the square of sqrt(19) + sqrt(39) is a bit larger than the square of sqrt(14) + sqrt(46). So, that also makes sense.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can approximate the square roots more precisely and compute A and B numerically to see which is larger. Let me try that.\n\nCompute sqrt(14):\nsqrt(9) = 3, sqrt(16)=4, so sqrt(14) is about 3.7417.\n\nCompute sqrt(46):\nsqrt(36) = 6, sqrt(49)=7, so sqrt(46) is around 6.7823.\n\nSo, A = 3.7417 + 6.7823 ≈10.524.\n\nCompute sqrt(19):\nsqrt(16)=4, sqrt(25)=5, so sqrt(19)≈4.3589.\n\nCompute sqrt(39):\nsqrt(36)=6, sqrt(49)=7, so sqrt(39)≈6.2449.\n\nSo, B = 4.3589 + 6.2449≈10.6038.\n\nComparing A≈10.524 and B≈10.6038, so B is larger. So, again, sqrt(19) + sqrt(39) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the difference in the square roots. Let me compute sqrt(19) - sqrt(14) and sqrt(39) - sqrt(46). If one is larger than the other, it might affect the sum.\n\nCompute sqrt(19) - sqrt(14)≈4.3589 - 3.7417≈0.6172.\n\nCompute sqrt(39) - sqrt(46)≈6.2449 - 6.7823≈-0.5374.\n\nSo, sqrt(19) is about 0.6172 larger than sqrt(14), but sqrt(39) is about 0.5374 less than sqrt(46). Therefore, the net effect on the sum A and B is (0.6172 - 0.5374)≈0.0798. So, A is about 0.0798 less than B, but when we square them, the difference becomes significant.\n\nWait, so the linear approximation might not be sufficient here. Maybe I need to consider the second-order terms when expanding (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))².\n\nLet me recall that (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))² = a + b + 2*sqrt(ab). So, the difference between A² and B² is 2*(sqrt(644) - sqrt(741)). Since sqrt(644) < sqrt(741), this difference is negative, so A² - B² is negative, so A² < B², hence A < B.\n\nTherefore, A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(46) is less than B = sqrt(19) + sqrt(39).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of using inequalities involving square roots. I remember that for positive numbers, if a > c and b > d, then sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) > sqrt(c) + sqrt(d) if certain conditions hold. But I'm not sure if that's a general rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the concept that the function f(x) = sqrt(x) is concave, so by Jensen's inequality, the sum sqrt(14) + sqrt(46) compared to sqrt(19) + sqrt(39). Maybe the sum is larger when the numbers are more balanced? Let me see.\n\nWait, 14 and 4"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(2) + sqrt(48) and sqrt(12) + sqrt(22). I need to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't play nice like regular numbers do. I remember that sometimes you can simplify square roots or even rationalize them, but I'm not sure if that will help here. Maybe I can try to express both expressions in a similar form or see if one is definitely larger than the other without crunching too many numbers.\n\nLooking at the first expression: sqrt(2) + sqrt(48). I notice that 48 can be broken down into 16 * 3, right? So sqrt(48) is sqrt(16*3), which simplifies to sqrt(16)*sqrt(3) = 4*sqrt(3). So, sqrt(48) is 4*sqrt(3). That means the first expression becomes sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(3).\n\nNow, the second expression is sqrt(12) + sqrt(22). Let me see if I can simplify those as well. 12 is 4*3, so sqrt(12) is sqrt(4*3) = 2*sqrt(3). So, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). Therefore, the second expression becomes 2*sqrt(3) + sqrt(22).\n\nSo now, both expressions are rewritten as:\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(3)\n\nSecond expression: 2*sqrt(3) + sqrt(22)\n\nSo, to compare sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(3) and 2*sqrt(3) + sqrt(22), I can subtract one from the other and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nLet me subtract the second expression from the first:\n\n[sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(3)] - [2*sqrt(3) + sqrt(22)] = sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(3) - 2*sqrt(3) - sqrt(22)\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nsqrt(2) + (4*sqrt(3) - 2*sqrt(3)) - sqrt(22) = sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(3) - sqrt(22)\n\nSo, that simplifies to sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(3) - sqrt(22). If this is positive, then the first expression is larger; if it's negative, the second is larger.\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(3) is greater than sqrt(22) or not.\n\nI think I can approximate these square roots to see which one is bigger.\n\nLet me recall some approximate values:\n\nsqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.7321\n\nsqrt(22) is approximately 4.6904\n\nSo, let me plug these approximate values into the expression sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(3) - sqrt(22):\n\n1.4142 + 2*(1.7321) - 4.6904\n\nFirst, compute 2*(1.7321): that's 3.4642\n\nNow, add sqrt(2): 1.4142 + 3.4642 = 4.8784\n\nThen subtract sqrt(22): 4.8784 - 4.6904 = 0.188\n\nSo, the difference is approximately 0.188, which is positive. Therefore, sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(3) is greater than sqrt(22), meaning the first expression sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(3) is greater than the second expression 2*sqrt(3) + sqrt(22).\n\nTherefore, sqrt(2) + sqrt(48) is larger than sqrt(12) + sqrt(22). So, the larger number is sqrt(2) + sqrt(48), which can be written as sqrt(2) + sqrt(48).\n\nWait, before I conclude, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, sqrt(48) is 4*sqrt(3). So, sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(3). That's correct.\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3). So, 2*sqrt(3) + sqrt(22). Correct.\n\nSubtracting the second from the first: sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(3) - 2*sqrt(3) - sqrt(22) = sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(3) - sqrt(22). That's right.\n\nThen, plugging in the approximate values:\n\n1.4142 + 2*1.7321 = 1.4142 + 3.4642 = 4.8784\n\n4.8784 - 4.6904 = 0.188\n\nSo, yes, the difference is positive. Therefore, the original expression sqrt(2) + sqrt(48) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, just to explore another angle, maybe I can square both expressions to compare them? Although squaring might complicate things, but let me try.\n\nLet me denote expression A as sqrt(2) + sqrt(48) and expression B as sqrt(12) + sqrt(22). Let me compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nCompute A^2: (sqrt(2) + sqrt(48))^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(48) + (sqrt(48))^2\n\nWhich is 2 + 2*sqrt(96) + 48.\n\nSimplify: 2 + 48 = 50, so A^2 = 50 + 2*sqrt(96).\n\nSimilarly, compute B^2: (sqrt(12) + sqrt(22))^2 = (sqrt(12))^2 + 2*sqrt(12)*sqrt(22) + (sqrt(22))^2\n\nWhich is 12 + 2*sqrt(264) + 22.\n\nSimplify: 12 + 22 = 34, so B^2 = 34 + 2*sqrt(264).\n\nNow, comparing A^2 and B^2: A^2 = 50 + 2*sqrt(96); B^2 = 34 + 2*sqrt(264).\n\nHmm, so to compare 50 + 2*sqrt(96) and 34 + 2*sqrt(264), we can subtract 34 from both to get: 16 + 2*sqrt(96) vs. 2*sqrt(264).\n\nSo, 16 + 2*sqrt(96) vs. 2*sqrt(264). Let me compute the numerical values.\n\nsqrt(96) is approximately 9.798, so 2*sqrt(96) is approximately 19.596.\n\nAdding 16: 16 + 19.596 = 35.596.\n\nsqrt(264) is approximately 16.248, so 2*sqrt(264) is approximately 32.496.\n\nSo, 35.596 vs. 32.496. Therefore, 50 + 2*sqrt(96) is approximately 35.596 + 16 = 51.596? Wait, hold on, no, wait.\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, A^2 = 50 + 2*sqrt(96). So, 50 is 50, and 2*sqrt(96) is approximately 19.596, so A^2 is approximately 50 + 19.596 = 69.596.\n\nSimilarly, B^2 is 34 + 2*sqrt(264). 2*sqrt(264) is approximately 32.496, so B^2 is approximately 34 + 32.496 = 66.496.\n\nTherefore, A^2 is approximately 69.596, and B^2 is approximately 66.496. Since 69.596 > 66.496, it follows that A^2 > B^2, which implies that A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(2) + sqrt(48) is indeed larger than sqrt(12) + sqrt(22). So, the larger number is sqrt(2) + sqrt(48).\n\nWait a second, so"

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that comparing square roots isn't always straightforward because they don't follow the same rules as regular numbers. So, I can't just subtract or add them directly. I might need to evaluate each expression separately to see which one is larger.\n\nLet me start with the first expression: sqrt(9) + sqrt(50). I know that sqrt(9) is 3 because 3 squared is 9. Then, sqrt(50) is a bit trickier. I remember that 7 squared is 49 and 8 squared is 64, so sqrt(50) should be somewhere between 7 and 8. To get a better approximation, maybe I can think about 7.07 squared, because I know that 7.07 times 7.07 is approximately 50. Let me check that: 7.07 times 7 is 49.49, and 7.07 times 0.07 is about 0.495. Adding those together gives approximately 50. So, sqrt(50) is approximately 7.07.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(9) + sqrt(50) is approximately 3 + 7.07, which is 10.07.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(35) + sqrt(49). I know that sqrt(49) is 7 because 7 squared is 49. Then, sqrt(35) is between 5 and 6 because 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36. So, sqrt(35) is approximately 5.916. Let me verify that: 5.916 squared is approximately 35. Let me calculate 5.9 squared, which is 34.81, and 5.916 squared is a bit more. So, yeah, sqrt(35) is approximately 5.916.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(35) + sqrt(49) is approximately 5.916 + 7, which is about 12.916.\n\nComparing the two results: the first expression is approximately 10.07, and the second is approximately 12.916. So, clearly, sqrt(35) + sqrt(49) is larger.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). I already have the second expression as sqrt(35) + sqrt(49), which fits the form. So, that should be the answer.\n\nHowever, let me think if there's another way to compare these without approximating. Maybe I can square both expressions and compare the results. That might be a more precise method.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(9) + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(35) + sqrt(49). I want to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square A: A² = (sqrt(9) + sqrt(50))². Expanding that, it's sqrt(9)² + 2*sqrt(9)*sqrt(50) + sqrt(50)². Calculating each term:\n\nsqrt(9)² = 9,\n\nsqrt(50)² = 50,\n\nand the middle term is 2*sqrt(9*50). Let me compute that:\n\nsqrt(9) = 3,\n\nsqrt(50) = 5*sqrt(2),\n\nso 9*50 = 450,\n\nsqrt(450) = sqrt(225*2) = 15*sqrt(2),\n\nhence, 2*sqrt(450) = 2*15*sqrt(2) = 30*sqrt(2).\n\nSo, A² = 9 + 30*sqrt(2) + 50 = 59 + 30*sqrt(2).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute B² = (sqrt(35) + sqrt(49))².\n\nExpanding that, it's sqrt(35)² + 2*sqrt(35)*sqrt(49) + sqrt(49)².\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nsqrt(35)² = 35,\n\nsqrt(49)² = 49,\n\nand the middle term is 2*sqrt(35*49). Let's compute that:\n\n35*49: 35*50 is 1750, so 35*49 is 1750 - 35 = 1715.\n\nsqrt(1715). Hmm, 1715 can be factored into 25*68.6, but that might not help. Alternatively, 1715 divided by 25 is 68.6, which isn't a perfect square. Alternatively, 1715 is 35*49, which is 5*7*7*7, but that's not helpful either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can leave it as 2*sqrt(1715). So, 2*sqrt(1715).\n\nSo, B² = 35 + 2*sqrt(1715) + 49 = 84 + 2*sqrt(1715).\n\nNow, to compare A² and B², which is 59 + 30*sqrt(2) versus 84 + 2*sqrt(1715). Let me compute the numerical values to see which is larger.\n\nFirst, compute 30*sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, 30*1.4142 is approximately 42.426.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 59 + 42.426 = 101.426.\n\nNext, compute 2*sqrt(1715). First, sqrt(1715). Let me estimate sqrt(1715). Since 41² = 1681 and 42² = 1764. So sqrt(1715) is between 41 and 42. Let's compute 41.4²: 41.4*41.4 = (40 + 1.4)(40 + 1.4) = 40² + 2*40*1.4 + 1.4² = 1600 + 112 + 1.96 = 1713.96. That's very close to 1715. So, sqrt(1715) is approximately 41.4 + a little bit.\n\nLet's compute 41.4² = 1713.96,\n\nso 1715 - 1713.96 = 1.04.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1715) is approximately 41.4 + (1.04)/(2*41.4) ≈ 41.4 + 1.04/82.8 ≈ 41.4 + 0.0125 ≈ 41.4125.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(1715) ≈ 2*41.4125 ≈ 82.825.\n\nSo, B² ≈ 84 + 82.825 ≈ 166.825.\n\nWait, hold on. That can't be right because earlier when I approximated A and B separately, I got A ≈ 10.07 and B ≈ 12.916. Then, A² ≈ 101.426 and B² ≈ 166.825, which would make B larger, which matches my initial conclusion.\n\nBut wait, but 166.825 is way bigger than 101.426, so that's consistent. So, in terms of squares, B is larger, hence B is larger than A.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 59 + 30*sqrt(2) vs 84 + 2*sqrt(1715).\n\nCompute 30*sqrt(2) ≈ 42.426,\n\nso 59 + 42.426 ≈ 101.426,\n\nand 2*sqrt(1715) ≈ 82.825,\n\nso 84 + 82.825 ≈ 166.825.\n\nYes, 166.825 is bigger than 101.426, so B² is bigger than A², so B is bigger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(35) + sqrt(49) is larger.\n\nSo, the problem asks to write down the"

Let me calculate that:\n\n6*6 is 36, 6*0.855 is 5.13, 0.855*6 is another 5.13, and 0.855*0.855 is roughly 0.731. Adding those up: 36 + 5.13 + 5.13 + 0.731 is about 46.991. So, that's pretty close to 47. So, sqrt(47) is approximately 6.855.\n\nNext, sqrt(35). I know that 5.9 squared is 34.81, which is just a bit less than 35, so sqrt(35) is just a tiny bit more than 5.9. Let me calculate 5.9 squared: 5.9*5.9 is 34.81. Then, 5.91 squared is (5.9 + 0.01)^2 = 5.9^2 + 2*5.9*0.01 + 0.01^2 = 34.81 + 0.118 + 0.0001 = 34.9281. Still a bit less than 35. Let's try 5.916 squared: 5.916*5.916. Let me break that down.\n\nFirst, 5*5 is 25. 5*0.916 is 4.58. 0.916*5 is another 4.58. 0.916*0.916 is approximately 0.839. So, adding up: 25 + 4.58 + 4.58 + 0.839. That's 25 + 9.16 + 0.839, which is 25 + 10.0, which is 35. So, sqrt(35) is approximately 5.916.\n\nSo, sqrt(47) + sqrt(35) is about 6.855 + 5.916, which is approximately 12.771.\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I thought sqrt(16) + sqrt(11) was about 7.3166 and this other expression is about 12.771. So, 12.771 is definitely larger than 7.3166. So, sqrt(47) + sqrt(35) is larger.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in approximations. Maybe my approximations are too rough. Let me think of another way to compare these expressions without approximating.\n\nI remember that for square roots, if you have two numbers, sqrt(a) and sqrt(b), their sum can sometimes be compared by considering the squares of their sums. Maybe I can square both expressions and compare those.\n\nSo, let's denote A = sqrt(11) + sqrt(47) and B = sqrt(16) + sqrt(35). Then, A^2 = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(47))^2 = 11 + 47 + 2*sqrt(11*47) = 58 + 2*sqrt(517). Similarly, B^2 = (sqrt(16) + sqrt(35))^2 = 16 + 35 + 2*sqrt(16*35) = 51 + 2*sqrt(560).\n\nSo, A^2 = 58 + 2*sqrt(517) and B^2 = 51 + 2*sqrt(560). Now, to compare A and B, it's enough to compare A^2 and B^2 since both A and B are positive.\n\nSo, let's compute A^2 - B^2 = (58 + 2*sqrt(517)) - (51 + 2*sqrt(560)) = 7 + 2*(sqrt(517) - sqrt(560)).\n\nNow, we need to figure out whether sqrt(517) is greater than sqrt(560), which would make the entire expression positive, meaning A^2 > B^2, so A > B.\n\nBut we know that 517 and 560 are both positive numbers, and sqrt(517) is less than sqrt(560) because 560 is larger. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Wait, 517 is less than 560, but sqrt(517) is actually less than sqrt(560). Hmm, let me compute sqrt(517) and sqrt(560) to check.\n\nWait, 22 squared is 484, 23 squared is 529, 24 squared is 576. So, sqrt(517) is between 22 and 23, closer to 22.8 because 22.8 squared is 519.84, which is very close to 517. Similarly, sqrt(560) is between 23 and 24, closer to 23.66 because 23.66 squared is approximately 559.7956, which is close to 560.\n\nSo, sqrt(517) is approximately 22.73 and sqrt(560) is approximately 23.66. Therefore, sqrt(517) - sqrt(560) is approximately 22.73 - 23.66, which is about -0.93. So, 2*(sqrt(517) - sqrt(560)) is about -1.86.\n\nTherefore, A^2 - B^2 = 7 + (-1.86) = 5.14. So, A^2 is approximately 5.14 larger than B^2, which means A is approximately sqrt(5.14) larger than B. So, A is definitely larger than B.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure my calculations are correct. Let me double-check the difference between sqrt(517) and sqrt(560). 22.73 - 23.66 = -0.93, so yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, A^2 is 58 + 2*sqrt(517) ≈ 58 + 2*22.73 ≈ 58 + 45.46 ≈ 103.46.\n\nB^2 is 51 + 2*sqrt(560) ≈ 51 + 2*23.66 ≈ 51 + 47.32 ≈ 98.32.\n\nThen, A^2 - B^2 ≈ 103.46 - 98.32 ≈ 5.14, which is positive, confirming that A is larger than B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should also check whether each individual term in sqrt(11) + sqrt(47) is larger than those in sqrt(16) + sqrt(35). Maybe that's another way to approach it.\n\nSo, sqrt(11) is about 3.316, sqrt(16) is 4. So, sqrt(11) < sqrt(16). Similarly, sqrt(47) is about 6.855, which is more than sqrt(35) ≈ 5.916. So, sqrt(47) > sqrt(35). Therefore, the total sum sqrt(11) + sqrt(47)"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(9) + sqrt(42) and sqrt(28) + sqrt(30). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare the sum of two square roots, sqrt(9) + sqrt(42), and sqrt(28) + sqrt(30). The question is asking which one is larger and to write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(9) is 3 because 3 squared is 9. That part is straightforward. So, sqrt(9) is just 3. Then, sqrt(42) is something else. Let me see, sqrt(42) is between sqrt(36) and sqrt(49), which are 6 and 7, so sqrt(42) should be about 6.48 or something like that. So, adding that to 3, we get about 9.48.\n\nOn the other side, sqrt(28) is a bit trickier. Let me calculate that. I know that 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36, so sqrt(28) is somewhere between 5 and 6. Specifically, sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(28) must be a bit more. I can approximate it using linear interpolation or maybe just know that 5.29 squared is 28 because 5.29 * 5.29 is roughly 28. Let me check: 5 * 5 is 25, 0.29 * 5 is 1.45, so 5.29 * 5 is 26.45, and then 0.29 squared is about 0.0841, so adding that in, 26.45 + 0.0841 is approximately 26.5341. Wait, that can't be right because 5.29 squared is actually 27.9841, which is just over 28. So, maybe 5.29 is a bit low. Let me try 5.29 squared: 5.29 * 5.29.\n\nCalculating 5 * 5.29 is 26.45, and 0.29 * 5.29 is approximately 1.5341. Adding those together, 26.45 + 1.5341 is 27.9841, which is very close to 28. So, sqrt(28) is approximately 5.29. Therefore, sqrt(28) + sqrt(30) would be 5.29 + sqrt(30). Now, sqrt(30) is between 5 and 6, right? 5.476 squared is approximately 30 because 5.476 * 5.476 is roughly 30. Let me verify: 5 * 5 is 25, 5 * 0.476 is about 2.38, 0.476 * 5 is another 2.38, and 0.476 * 0.476 is about 0.2266. Adding those up: 25 + 2.38 + 2.38 + 0.2266 is approximately 30. So, sqrt(30) is about 5.477. Thus, sqrt(28) + sqrt(30) is about 5.29 + 5.477, which is roughly 10.767.\n\nWait a second, earlier I thought sqrt(42) was about 6.48, so sqrt(9) + sqrt(42) is 3 + 6.48, which is 9.48, and sqrt(28) + sqrt(30) is approximately 10.767. So, from these approximate calculations, it seems like sqrt(28) + sqrt(30) is larger because 10.767 is greater than 9.48. But wait, maybe my approximations are off? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can square both expressions to compare them exactly, since squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers. So, let me let A = sqrt(9) + sqrt(42) and B = sqrt(28) + sqrt(30). Then, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and see which is larger.\n\nCalculating A^2: (sqrt(9) + sqrt(42))^2 = (sqrt(9))^2 + 2*sqrt(9)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))^2 = 9 + 2*sqrt(378) + 42. Simplifying that, 9 + 42 is 51, so A^2 = 51 + 2*sqrt(378). Similarly, calculating B^2: (sqrt(28) + sqrt(30))^2 = (sqrt(28))^2 + 2*sqrt(28)*sqrt(30) + (sqrt(30))^2 = 28 + 2*sqrt(840) + 30. That's 28 + 30 is 58, so B^2 = 58 + 2*sqrt(840).\n\nNow, to compare A^2 and B^2, let's subtract A^2 from B^2: B^2 - A^2 = (58 + 2*sqrt(840)) - (51 + 2*sqrt(378)) = (58 - 51) + 2*(sqrt(840) - sqrt(378)) = 7 + 2*(sqrt(840) - sqrt(378)).\n\nSo, the difference B^2 - A^2 is 7 plus twice the difference of sqrt(840) and sqrt(378). Let me compute sqrt(840) and sqrt(378).\n\nFirst, sqrt(840). Let's see, 29 squared is 841, so sqrt(840) is just a tiny bit less than 29, approximately 28.98. Similarly, sqrt(378). Let me compute that: 19 squared is 361, 20 squared is 400, so sqrt(378) is between 19 and 20. Let's calculate 19.4 squared: 19.4 * 19.4. 19 * 19 is 361, 19 * 0.4 is 7.6, 0.4 * 19 is another 7.6, and 0.4 * 0.4 is 0.16. So adding those up: 361 + 7.6 + 7.6 + 0.16 = 361 + 15.2 + 0.16 = 376.36. Close to 378. So, 19.4 squared is 376.36, so sqrt(378) is about 19.45. Let me check 19.45 squared: 19 + 0.45, so (19 + 0.45)^2 = 19^2 + 2*19*0.45 + 0.45^2 = 361 + 17.1 + 0.2025 = 361 + 17.1 is 378.1, plus 0.2025 is 378.3025. That's just over 378, so sqrt(378) is approximately 19.45 minus a tiny bit. Let me say approximately 19.45.\n\nSo, sqrt(840) is approximately 29 - a tiny bit, and sqrt(378) is approximately 19.45. Therefore, sqrt(840) - sqrt(378) is approximately 29 - 19.45, which is 9.55. So, 2*(sqrt(840) - sqrt(378)) is approximately 2*9.55, which is 19.1.\n\nTherefore, B^2 - A^2 is approximately 7 + 19.1, which is 26.1. So, B^2 is greater than A^2 by about 26.1, meaning B is greater than A. Therefore, sqrt(28) + sqrt(30) is larger than sqrt(9) + sqrt(42).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because approximating square roots can be tricky. Maybe I should calculate B^2 - A^2 more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express sqrt(378) and sqrt(840) in terms of sqrt(9*42) and sqrt(28*30). Wait, sqrt(378) is sqrt(9*42) which is"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(38). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to compare sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(38). Then, figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Okay, let me start by understanding what I'm being asked to do.\n\nFirst, let me compute each of these square roots separately to see what they equal. That way, I can add them up and compare the results. So, starting with sqrt(1). I know that 1 times 1 is 1, so that should be straightforward. sqrt(1) is 1. Got that down.\n\nNext, sqrt(49). Hmm, 49 is a perfect square because 7 times 7 is 49. So, sqrt(49) must be 7. Okay, so far so good. Now, moving on to the other side of the comparison: sqrt(18) and sqrt(38). These aren't perfect squares, so I'll need to approximate their values or find exact forms if possible.\n\nLet me start with sqrt(18). I can factor 18 into 9 and 2 because 9 times 2 is 18. So, sqrt(18) can be rewritten as sqrt(9*2). I remember that the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, so this becomes sqrt(9) times sqrt(2). sqrt(9) is 3, so sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2). I can leave it like this for now, but maybe I can approximate it numerically.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(38). Let's factor 38. 38 can be broken down into 19 and 2 because 19 times 2 is 38. So, sqrt(38) is sqrt(19*2), which is sqrt(19) times sqrt(2). Hmm, 19 is a prime number, so it doesn't have any square factors, meaning sqrt(19) is irrational and can't be simplified further. So, sqrt(38) is approximately sqrt(19)*sqrt(2). Let me compute these approximations.\n\nFirst, let's calculate sqrt(18). As I said, sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2). Let me compute sqrt(2). I know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142. So, multiplying that by 3, we get 3 * 1.4142 = approximately 4.2426. So, sqrt(18) ≈ 4.2426.\n\nNow, sqrt(38). Let's compute sqrt(19) first. 19 is close to 16 and 25, so sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(25) is 5. So, sqrt(19) is somewhere between 4 and 5. To approximate it, I can note that 4.3 squared is 18.49, which is less than 19, and 4.4 squared is 19.36, which is very close to 19. So, sqrt(19) is approximately 4.3589. Let me write that down: sqrt(19) ≈ 4.3589.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(38) is sqrt(19)*sqrt(2) ≈ 4.3589 * 1.4142. Let me compute that. 4.3589 multiplied by 1.4142. Let's break that down: 4 * 1.4142 is 5.6568, 0.3589 * 1.4142 is approximately 0.506. So, adding those together, 5.6568 + 0.506 ≈ 6.1628. So, sqrt(38) ≈ 6.1628.\n\nOkay, so now I have:\n\nsqrt(1) = 1\n\nsqrt(49) = 7\n\nSo, sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nAnd sqrt(18) + sqrt(38) ≈ 4.2426 + 6.1628 ≈ 10.4054.\n\nWait, hold on, 4.2426 + 6.1628. Let me add those again. 4 + 6 is 10, 0.2426 + 0.1628 is approximately 0.4054. So, yes, that gives 10.4054.\n\nWait, but that seems really high. 8 vs. approximately 10.4054? So, sqrt(18) + sqrt(38) is about 10.4, which is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) which is 8. So, sqrt(18) + sqrt(38) is larger.\n\nBut hold on, before I get too confident, let me double-check my calculations because 10.4 seems a bit large, but maybe it's correct.\n\nLet me confirm sqrt(18). sqrt(18) is 4.2426. Let me square that: 4.2426^2. 4^2 is 16, 0.2426^2 is approximately 0.0588, and the cross term is 2*4*0.2426 = 1.9408. So, adding them up: 16 + 1.9408 + 0.0588 ≈ 18.00. That checks out.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(38) is 6.1628. Let me square that: 6^2 is 36, 0.1628^2 is approximately 0.0265, and the cross term is 2*6*0.1628 ≈ 1.9536. Adding them: 36 + 1.9536 + 0.0265 ≈ 38.00. That also checks out.\n\nSo, sqrt(18) ≈ 4.2426 and sqrt(38) ≈ 6.1628.\n\nThen, adding 4.2426 + 6.1628: 4 + 6 = 10, 0.2426 + 0.1628 = 0.4054, so total is approximately 10.4054.\n\nSo, indeed, sqrt(18) + sqrt(38) ≈ 10.4054 is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) = 8.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(18) + sqrt(38), which is approximately 10.4054, so we can write that as sqrt(18) + sqrt(38).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, is there a way to compare sqrt(18) + sqrt(38) and sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) without computing their approximate decimal values? Maybe by squaring both sides?\n\nLet me try that. Let's let A = sqrt(18) + sqrt(38) and B = sqrt(1) + sqrt(49) = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nWe can compare A and B by computing A^2 and B^2 and seeing which is larger.\n\nCompute A^2 = (sqrt(18) + sqrt(38))^2 = (sqrt(18))^2 + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(38) + (sqrt(38))^2.\n\nWhich simplifies to 18 + 2*sqrt(18*38) + 38.\n\nSo, 18 + 38 = 56, so A^2 = 56 + 2*sqrt(702).\n\nWait, 18*38 is 702, right? Because 18*30 is 540 and 18*8 is 144, so 540 + 144 = 684. Wait, hold on, 18*38: 38 is 40 - 2, so 18*40 is 720, minus 18*2 is 36, so 720 - 36 = 684. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, no, 18*38 is 684, not 702.\n\nSo, sqrt(18*38) is sqrt(684). So, A^2 is 56 + 2*sqrt(684).\n\nSimilarly, compute B^2 = 8^2 = 64.\n\nSo, now we need to compare A^2 and B^2, which are 56 + 2*sqrt(684) and 64.\n\nSo, subtract 56 from both sides:"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(1) + sqrt(38) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(15) or vice versa. Hmm, let me write this down to visualize it better:\n\nsqrt(1) + sqrt(38) vs. sqrt(5) + sqrt(15)\n\nFirst, I know sqrt(1) is just 1, since the square root of 1 is 1. So that part is straightforward. Now, sqrt(38) is another term I need to evaluate. Let me see, sqrt(36) is 6, and sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(38) should be somewhere between 6 and 7, maybe around 6.16 or something. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\nCalculating sqrt(38):\n\n6.16^2 = 37.9456 (because 6.16*6.16 = 37.9456)\n6.17^2 = 38.0689 (since 6.17*6.17 = 38.0689)\nSo, sqrt(38) is approximately 6.17.\n\nSo, sqrt(1) + sqrt(38) ≈ 1 + 6.17 = 7.17.\n\nNow, let's calculate sqrt(5) + sqrt(15). Again, sqrt(5) is about 2.236, and sqrt(15) is about 3.872. Let me verify these:\n\n2.236^2 = 5.000 (exactly 5)\n3.872^2 = approximately 14.999 (since 3.872*3.872 ≈ 14.999). So sqrt(15) is roughly 3.872.\n\nAdding them together: 2.236 + 3.872 ≈ 6.108.\n\nWait a second, so sqrt(5) + sqrt(15) is approximately 6.108, while sqrt(1) + sqrt(38) is about 7.17. So, 7.17 is larger than 6.108. Therefore, sqrt(1) + sqrt(38) is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I did the calculations correctly.

So A^2 is approximately 51.34 and B^2 is approximately 37.32. Since 51.34 > 37.32, that means A > B. So, sqrt(1) + sqrt(38) is larger.\n\nHmm, but earlier when I estimated sqrt(38) as 6.17, 1 + 6.17 is 7.17, and sqrt(5) + sqrt(15) is roughly 2.236 + 3.872 ≈ 6.108. So 7.17 is indeed larger than 6.108. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the squaring method. When squaring, can we make a mistake?\n\nA^2 = 1 + 2*sqrt(38) + 38 = 39 + 2*sqrt(38)\n\nB^2 = 5 + 2*sqrt(75) + 15 = 20 + 2*sqrt(75)\n\nCompute 2*sqrt(38) and 2*sqrt(75):\n\nsqrt(38) ≈ 6.164, so 2*sqrt(38) ≈ 12.328\n\nsqrt(75) ≈ 8.660, so 2*sqrt(75) ≈ 17.320\n\nTherefore, A^2 ≈ 39 + 12.328 ≈ 51.328\n\nB^2 ≈ 20 + 17.320 ≈ 37.320\n\nSo, 51.328 > 37.320, so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1) + sqrt(38) is larger.\n\nWait, so both methods gave me the same result. So, the conclusion is that sqrt(1) + sqrt(38) is larger.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approximate the exact values more precisely.\n\nCompute sqrt(38):\n\nWe know 6.16^2 = 37.9456\n\n6.17^2 = 6.17*6.17: Let's compute 6*6 = 36, 6*0.17 = 1.02, 0.17*6 = 1.02, 0.17*0.17 = 0.0289\n\nSo, 6.17^2 = (6 + 0.17)^2 = 6^2 + 2*6*0.17 + 0.17^2 = 36 + 2.04 + 0.0289 = 36 + 2.04 = 38.04 + 0.0289 ≈ 38.0689\n\nSo, sqrt(38) is between 6.16 and 6.17. Let's compute 6.16^2 = 37.9456, 6.17^2 = 38.0689\n\nSo, 38 is 38 - 37.9456 = 0.0544 above 6.16^2.\n\nEach 0.001 increase in x leads to approximately 2*6.16*0.001 + (0.001)^2 ≈ 0.01232 per 0.001. So, 0.0544 / 0.01232 ≈ 4.414 increments of 0.001.\n\nSo, sqrt(38) ≈ 6.16 + 4.414*0.001 ≈ 6.164414\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, using linear approximation.\n\nLet f(x) = sqrt(x). Then f'(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)). So, sqrt(38) ≈ sqrt(36 + 2) ≈ sqrt(36) + (2)/(2*sqrt(36)) = 6 + 2/(12) = 6 + 1/6 ≈ 6.1667\n\nWait, that's a better approximation. So, sqrt(38) ≈ 6.1667.\n\nBut wait, using a calculator, sqrt(38) is approximately 6.16444.\n\nSo, 6.16444.\n\nThus, sqrt(1) + sqrt(38) ≈ 1 + 6.16444 ≈ 7.16444.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(5) ≈ 2.23607, and sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298.\n\nSo, sqrt(5) + sqrt(15) ≈ 2.23607 + 3.87298 ≈ 6.10905.\n\nSo, 7.16444 vs. 6.10905, so clearly 7.16444 is larger.\n\nSo, all these methods give me"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(26). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(26). I need to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(16) is 4 because 4 squared is 16. That's straightforward. So, sqrt(16) + sqrt(26) simplifies to 4 + sqrt(26). So, now my two expressions to compare are sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) and 4 + sqrt(26). I need to figure out which one is bigger.\n\nHmm, maybe I can subtract one from the other to see if it's positive or negative. Let's try that. Let me denote A as sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) and B as 4 + sqrt(26). So, I want to see if A > B or B > A.\n\nIf I subtract B from A, I get sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) - (4 + sqrt(26)). Let me write that out: sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) - 4 - sqrt(26). Now, I need to see if this is positive or negative.\n\nI can think about each term separately. Let's compute sqrt(8). sqrt(8) is the same as 2*sqrt(2), which is approximately 2.828. Similarly, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.082, sqrt(26) is approximately 5.099, and 4 is just 4. So plugging these approximate values in, we get: 2.828 + 6.082 - 4 - 5.099.\n\nCalculating that: 2.828 + 6.082 is about 8.910, minus 4 is 4.910, minus 5.099 is approximately 4.910 - 5.099 = -0.189. So, the result is approximately -0.189, which is negative. That means A - B is negative, so A < B. So, sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) is less than 4 + sqrt(26). Therefore, the larger one is 4 + sqrt(26).\n\nBut wait, let me verify this without approximating because sometimes approximations can be misleading. Maybe I can square both expressions to compare them.\n\nSo, if I square A, which is sqrt(8) + sqrt(37), I get (sqrt(8) + sqrt(37))² = (sqrt(8))² + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(37) + (sqrt(37))². Calculating each term: (sqrt(8))² is 8, (sqrt(37))² is 37, and 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(37) is 2*sqrt(296). Wait, sqrt(296) is equal to sqrt(4*74) which is 2*sqrt(74). Therefore, 2*sqrt(296) is 2*2*sqrt(74) = 4*sqrt(74). So, putting it all together, A² = 8 + 4*sqrt(74) + 37 = 45 + 4*sqrt(74).\n\nNow, let's compute B squared, which is (4 + sqrt(26))². Expanding that, we get 4² + 2*4*sqrt(26) + (sqrt(26))². Calculating each term: 4² is 16, 2*4*sqrt(26) is 8*sqrt(26), and (sqrt(26))² is 26. Adding them up, 16 + 26 is 42, so B² is 42 + 8*sqrt(26).\n\nSo, now, we need to compare A² and B²: 45 + 4*sqrt(74) vs. 42 + 8*sqrt(26). To make this comparison easier, let's subtract 42 from both sides: 45 - 42 is 3, so we have 3 + 4*sqrt(74) vs. 8*sqrt(26).\n\nSo, now we have to see whether 3 + 4*sqrt(74) is greater than or less than 8*sqrt(26). Hmm, maybe I can square both sides again to eliminate the square roots.\n\nWait, but before I do that, let me see if this approach is valid. Squaring both sides is a valid operation because both A and B are positive numbers (since square roots are positive), so their squares will preserve the inequality direction. So, if A² > B², then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's proceed. Let me denote X as 3 + 4*sqrt(74) and Y as 8*sqrt(26). We need to figure out if X > Y or X < Y.\n\nAgain, perhaps I can square both X and Y to see which one is larger. So, compute X² and Y² and compare.\n\nCalculating X²: (3 + 4*sqrt(74))². Expanding this, we get 3² + 2*3*4*sqrt(74) + (4*sqrt(74))². Calculating each term: 3² is 9, 2*3*4 is 24, so 24*sqrt(74), and (4*sqrt(74))² is 16*74. Let's compute 16*74: 16*70 is 1120, 16*4 is 64, so 1120 + 64 = 1184. So, X² is 9 + 24*sqrt(74) + 1184 = 1193 + 24*sqrt(74).\n\nNow, calculating Y²: (8*sqrt(26))². That's 64*(sqrt(26))², which is 64*26. Let's compute 64*26: 60*26 is 1560, 4*26 is 104, so 1560 + 104 = 1664. So, Y² is 1664.\n\nTherefore, now we have X² = 1193 + 24*sqrt(74) and Y² = 1664. So, to compare X and Y, we need to see if X² is greater than Y² or not.\n\nWait, so X squared is 1193 + 24*sqrt(74), and Y squared is 1664. So, 1193 + 24*sqrt(74) vs. 1664. Let's subtract 1193 from both sides: 24*sqrt(74) vs. 1664 - 1193 = 471.\n\nSo, the question now is: is 24*sqrt(74) greater than 471? If yes, then X² > Y², so X > Y, meaning sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) > 4 + sqrt(26). If not, then X² < Y², so sqrt(8) + sqrt(37) < 4 + sqrt(26).\n\nSo, let's compute 24*sqrt(74) and see if it's greater than 471.\n\nFirst, sqrt(74). Let me approximate sqrt(74). 8² is 64, 9² is 81, so sqrt(74) is between 8 and 9. Let me compute 8.5²: 8.5*8.5 is 72.25, which is less than 74. 8.6² is 73.96, still less than 74. 8.7² is 75.69, which is more than 74. So, sqrt(74) is between 8.6 and 8.7.\n\nTo approximate more accurately, let me compute 8.6² = 73.96, 8.61²: 8.61*8.61. Let me compute 8.6*8.6 is 73.96, then 8.61 is 8.6 + 0.01. So, (8.6 + 0.01)^2 = 8.6² + 2*8.6*0.01 + 0.01² = 73.96 + 0.172 + 0.0001 = 74.1321. Hmm, that's still less than 74. So, 8.61² is"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out which is larger between sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(22). Hmm, okay, let me write them down again:\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(7) + sqrt(47)\nSecond expression: sqrt(16) + sqrt(22)\n\nI know that sqrt(16) is a whole number because 16 is a perfect square. Specifically, sqrt(16) is 4. So, the second expression simplifies to 4 + sqrt(22). That might make things a bit easier.\n\nSo now, the question is whether sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) is larger than 4 + sqrt(22). Maybe I can subtract sqrt(22) from both expressions to make it simpler. Let's see, that would give me:\n\nFirst expression minus sqrt(22): sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(22)\nSecond expression minus sqrt(22): 4\n\nSo now, I need to compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(22) and 4. If sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(22) is greater than 4, then the first expression is larger, otherwise, the second is larger.\n\nHmm, so how do I compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(22) with 4? Maybe I can square both sides? But wait, squaring might complicate things because when you square a sum, you get cross terms. However, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(22) and B = 4.\n\nSo, I want to compare A and B. Let's square A:\n\nA² = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(22))²\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\nA² = (sqrt(7))² + (sqrt(47))² + (sqrt(22))² + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(47) - 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(22) - 2*sqrt(47)*sqrt(22)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(7))² = 7\n(sqrt(47))² = 47\n(sqrt(22))² = 22\n\nSo, adding those up: 7 + 47 + 22 = 76\n\nNow, the cross terms:\n\n2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(47) = 2*sqrt(7*47) = 2*sqrt(329)\n-2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(22) = -2*sqrt(7*22) = -2*sqrt(154)\n-2*sqrt(47)*sqrt(22) = -2*sqrt(47*22) = -2*sqrt(1034)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nA² = 76 + 2*sqrt(329) - 2*sqrt(154) - 2*sqrt(1034)\n\nHmm, okay, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I should instead compute A numerically to see whether it's greater than 4 or not.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nsqrt(7): approximately 2.6458\nsqrt(47): approximately 6.8557\nsqrt(22): approximately 4.6904\n\nSo, A = 2.6458 + 6.8557 - 4.6904\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n2.6458 + 6.8557 = 9.5015\n9.5015 - 4.6904 = 4.8111\n\nSo, A is approximately 4.8111, which is greater than 4 (which is B). So, that would mean that sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(16) + sqrt(22).\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes when you subtract and square, you might introduce errors. Maybe I can compute A²?\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nA² = 76 + 2*sqrt(329) - 2*sqrt(154) - 2*sqrt(1034)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, sqrt(329): approximately 18.1407, so 2*sqrt(329) ≈ 36.2814\n\nsqrt(154): approximately 12.4097, so 2*sqrt(154) ≈ 24.8194\n\nsqrt(1034): approximately 32.1566, so 2*sqrt(1034) ≈ 64.3132\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n76 + 36.2814 - 24.8194 - 64.3132\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n76 + 36.2814 = 112.2814\n\n112.2814 - 24.8194 = 87.462\n\n87.462 - 64.3132 ≈ 23.1488\n\nSo, A² ≈ 23.1488, which is about the same as 4.8111 squared, which is indeed 23.1488. So, the calculation seems consistent.\n\nHence, A is approximately 4.8111, which is greater than 4. So, the original expression sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(16) + sqrt(22).\n\nBut wait a second, let me think again. When I subtracted sqrt(22), did I do that correctly? Because sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(16) + sqrt(22) is 4 + sqrt(22). Therefore, subtracting sqrt(22) from both expressions is correct, as I did.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) and 4 + sqrt(22) is to consider the difference:\n\n(sqrt(7) + sqrt(47)) - (4 + sqrt(22)) = sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) - sqrt(22) - 4 ≈ 4.8111 - 4 = 0.8111, which is positive. Hence, sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) is larger.\n\nIs there another way to compare without computing the approximate values? Maybe using inequalities or some algebraic manipulation?\n\nLet's think. Maybe I can compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(22) by using the fact that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) is an increasing function for a, b > 0. So, if I can show that 7 + 47 > 16 + 22, then sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) would be greater than sqrt(16) + sqrt(22). But wait, let's check:\n\n7 + 47 = 54\n16 + 22 = 38\n\n54 is greater than 38, so sqrt(54) would be greater than sqrt(38). But sqrt(54) is sqrt(9*6) = 3*sqrt(6) ≈ 7.348, and sqrt(38) ≈ 6.164. So, that supports the previous conclusion.\n\nHowever, in this case, the expressions are sqrt(7) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(22), not sqrt(54) and sqrt(38). So, maybe that approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality to compare these sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the squares of both expressions and compare them. Let me denote:\n\nLet A = sqrt(7) + sqrt(47)\nLet B = sqrt(16) + sqrt(22) = 4 + sqrt(22)\n\nCompute A² and B²:\n\nA² = 7 + 47 + 2*sqrt(7*47) = 54 + 2*sqrt(329)\nB² = (4 + sqrt(22))² = 16 + 2*sqrt(22)*4 + 22 = 38 + 8*sqrt(22)\n\nNow, compare A² and B²:\n\nWhich is larger, 54 + 2*sqrt(329) or 38 + 8*sqrt(22)?\n\nCompute the difference:\n\n(54 + 2*sqrt(329)) - (38 + 8*sqrt(22)) = 54 - 38 + 2*sqrt(329) - 8*sqrt(22) = 16 + 2*sqrt(329) - 8*sqrt"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which is larger: sqrt(1) + sqrt(42) or sqrt(34) + sqrt(40). Hmm, let me start by calculating each of these values approximately because dealing with square roots can sometimes be tricky.\n\nFirst, sqrt(1) is straightforward. That's just 1. Then sqrt(42). Hmm, I know that sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(42) should be a little less than 7. Maybe around 6.48? Let me check: 6.48 squared is 41.99, which is almost 42. Okay, so sqrt(42) ≈ 6.48.\n\nSo, sqrt(1) + sqrt(42) is approximately 1 + 6.48, which is 7.48.\n\nNow, let me look at the other pair: sqrt(34) + sqrt(40). I'll start with sqrt(34). I know that sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(34) should be between 5 and 6. Let me calculate 5.8 squared: 5.8 * 5.8. 5*5 is 25, 5*0.8 is 4, 0.8*5 is another 4, and 0.8*0.8 is 0.64. So adding those up: 25 + 4 + 4 + 0.64 = 33.64. Hmm, that's less than 34. So, let's try 5.9 squared: 5.9 * 5.9. 5*5 is 25, 5*0.9 is 4.5, 0.9*5 is another 4.5, and 0.9*0.9 is 0.81. So adding those: 25 + 4.5 + 4.5 + 0.81 = 34.81. That's over 34, so sqrt(34) is between 5.8 and 5.9. Let's try 5.85 squared. 5.85 * 5.85. 5*5 is 25, 5*0.85 is 4.25, 0.85*5 is 4.25, and 0.85*0.85 is 0.7225. Adding those up: 25 + 4.25 + 4.25 + 0.7225 = 34.2225. That's still less than 34. So let's do 5.87 squared: 5.87 * 5.87. 5*5 is 25, 5*0.87 is 4.35, 0.87*5 is 4.35, and 0.87*0.87 is approximately 0.7569. Adding those: 25 + 4.35 + 4.35 + 0.7569 ≈ 34.4569. That's getting closer, but still less than 34. Maybe 5.88 squared: 5.88 * 5.88. 5*5 is 25, 5*0.88 is 4.4, 0.88*5 is 4.4, and 0.88*0.88 is 0.7744. Adding: 25 + 4.4 + 4.4 + 0.7744 ≈ 34.5744. Still less than 34. Hmm, maybe 5.89 squared. 5.89 * 5.89. 5*5 is 25, 5*0.89 is 4.45, 0.89*5 is 4.45, and 0.89*0.89 is approximately 0.7921. Adding: 25 + 4.45 + 4.45 + 0.7921 ≈ 34.6921. Hmm, still under 34. Maybe I need a more precise method.\n\nAlternatively, since 5.87^2 ≈ 34.4569 and 5.88^2 ≈ 34.5744, so sqrt(34) is approximately between 5.87 and 5.88. Let's do linear approximation. The difference between 5.87 and 5.88 is 0.01, and the difference between 34.4569 and 34.5744 is 0.1175. Since 34 is 0.5431 above 34.4569, which is 34 - 34.4569 = -0.4569. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, to find x such that x^2 = 34, where x is between 5.87 and 5.88.\n\nLet’s set up the equation: (5.87 + t)^2 = 34, where t is between 0 and 0.01.\n\nExpanding: 5.87^2 + 2*5.87*t + t^2 = 34.\n\nWe know 5.87^2 ≈ 34.4569.\n\nSo, 34.4569 + 11.74*t + t^2 = 34.\n\nSubtract 34: 0.4569 + 11.74*t + t^2 = 0.\n\nAssuming t is small, t^2 is negligible, so approximate:\n\n0.4569 + 11.74*t ≈ 0\n\nThus, t ≈ -0.4569 / 11.74 ≈ -0.0389.\n\nBut t is positive, so perhaps my approximation is off. Alternatively, maybe I should use a better method.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the Newton-Raphson method. Let f(x) = x^2 - 34. We want f(x)=0.\n\nStarting with x0 = 5.87, f(x0)=5.87^2 -34=34.4569-34=0.4569.\n\nf'(x0)=2*5.87=11.74.\n\nNext iteration: x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 5.87 - 0.4569 / 11.74 ≈ 5.87 - 0.0389 ≈ 5.8311.\n\nCompute f(x1)=5.8311^2=?\n\nLet me calculate 5.83^2: 5^2 + 2*5*0.83 + 0.83^2 =25 + 8.3 + 0.6889=34.9889.\n\nWait, 5.83^2=34.9889, but x1 is 5.8311, which is a bit more.\n\nCompute 5.8311^2: 5.83^2 + 2*5.83*(0.0011) + (0.0011)^2 ≈34.9889 + 0.012766 + 0.00000121≈34.9889 + 0.012766≈35.0017. That's over 34.\n\nSo f(x1)=5.8311^2 -34≈35.0017 -34≈1.0017.\n\nCompute f'(x1)=2*5.8311≈11.6622.\n\nNext iteration: x2 = x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1) ≈5.8311 -1.0017/11.6622≈5.8311 -0.0857≈5.7454.\n\nCompute f(x2)=5.7454^2.\n\n5.74^2=32.9476, 5.75^2=33.0625.

Alright, let's dive into this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they aren't linear like regular numbers. So, adding two square roots isn't the same as taking the square root of the sum. That is, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) isn't necessarily equal to sqrt(a + b). So, I can't just add 2 and 40 under a single square root to compare it with sqrt(13) + sqrt(16). Hmm, okay.\n\nMaybe I should calculate the approximate decimal values of each expression to see which one is larger. That might give me a clear idea of which one is bigger without getting bogged down in complicated algebra.\n\nLet's start with sqrt(2) + sqrt(40). I know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, and sqrt(40) is about 6.3246. Adding those together: 1.4142 + 6.3246. Let me add those: 1.4142 + 6.3246. Hmm, 1 + 6 is 7, and 0.4142 + 0.3246 is about 0.7388. So, adding those gives me approximately 7.7388. So, sqrt(2) + sqrt(40) is approximately 7.7388.\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(13) + sqrt(16). I know that sqrt(16) is 4 because 4 squared is 16. What about sqrt(13)? That's approximately 3.6055 because 3.6055 squared is roughly 13. Let me double-check that: 3.6055 * 3.6055. Let's see, 3 * 3 is 9, 0.6055 * 3 is about 1.8165, and 0.6055 squared is roughly 0.3666. Adding those parts together: 9 + 1.8165 + 0.3666, which is about 11.1831. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Hold on, I think I messed up the multiplication. Maybe I should use a better method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 3.6055 squared is approximately 13. Let me confirm that. 3.6055 squared. Let me write it as (3 + 0.6055)^2. Expanding that, it's 3^2 + 2*3*0.6055 + (0.6055)^2. So, that's 9 + 3.633 + 0.3666. Adding those together: 9 + 3.633 is 12.633, plus 0.3666 is 13. So, yes, 3.6055 squared is indeed approximately 13. So, sqrt(13) is approximately 3.6055, and sqrt(16) is 4. Therefore, adding those together: 3.6055 + 4. That gives me 7.6055.\n\nSo, sqrt(13) + sqrt(16) is approximately 7.6055, and sqrt(2) + sqrt(40) is approximately 7.7388. Comparing these two, 7.7388 is larger than 7.6055. So, it seems like sqrt(2) + sqrt(40) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(16).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes because it's easy to mix up the numbers sometimes. Let me verify the approximations again.\n\nFirst, sqrt(2): 1.4142 is correct because 1.4142 squared is approximately 2. Similarly, sqrt(40): 6.3246 is correct because 6.3246 squared is approximately 40. Adding those gives 7.7388.\n\nFor sqrt(13): 3.6055 is correct because 3.6055 squared is approximately 13, as we saw earlier. And sqrt(16) is 4, which is straightforward. So, adding those gives 7.6055.\n\nSo, 7.7388 is indeed larger than 7.6055. Therefore, sqrt(2) + sqrt(40) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(16).\n\nBut the problem also asks to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, in this case, the larger number is sqrt(2) + sqrt(40). But let me just make sure that this is indeed the case.\n\nWait, could there be a different combination of square roots that add up to a larger number? For instance, maybe sqrt(17) + sqrt(12) or something else? Let me check.\n\nWait, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.1231, and sqrt(12) is approximately 3.4641. Adding those together: 4.1231 + 3.4641 is about 7.5872, which is less than 7.7388. So, that's not bigger.\n\nWhat about sqrt(18) + sqrt(10)? Let's see, sqrt(18) is approximately 4.2426, and sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623. Adding those together: 4.2426 + 3.1623 is approximately 7.4049, which is still less than 7.7388.\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(20) + sqrt(8): sqrt(20) is about 4.4721, and sqrt(8) is about 2.8284. Adding those gives 7.3005, which is even smaller.\n\nSo, seems like sqrt(2) + sqrt(40) is the largest so far. Let me check another one: sqrt(25) + sqrt(5). Wait, sqrt(25) is 5, and sqrt(5) is approximately 2.2361. So, 5 + 2.2361 is 7.2361, which is still less than 7.7388.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Maybe I can try to see if sqrt(40) + sqrt(2) is actually larger than some other combination. Maybe sqrt(32) + sqrt(8). Let's see, sqrt(32) is about 5.6568, and sqrt(8) is about 2.8284. Adding those together: 5.6568 + 2.8284 is approximately 8.4852, which is way larger than 7.7388. Wait, hold on, that seems contradictory to the earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating sqrt(32) and sqrt(8). Let's recalculate.\n\nsqrt(32): 32 is 16 times 2, so sqrt(32) is sqrt(16*2) which is 4*sqrt(2), which is approximately 4*1.4142, which is 5.6568. That's correct.\n\nsqrt(8): 8 is 4*2, so sqrt(8) is 2*sqrt(2), which is approximately 2*1.4142, which is 2.8284. That's correct.\n\nSo, sqrt(32) + sqrt(8) is 5.6568 + 2.8284, which is approximately 8.4852. That's way larger than 7.7388. So, that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, so which one is larger? Is sqrt(2) + sqrt(40) or sqrt(32) + sqrt(8)?\n\nWait, let's compute sqrt(32) + sqrt(8) approximately: 5.6568 + 2.8284 is 8.4852. And sqrt(2) + sqrt(40) is approx 7.7388.\n\nSo, clearly, sqrt(32) + sqrt(8) is larger. Therefore, the initial conclusion that sqrt(2) + sqrt(40) is larger is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so now I need to reassess. So, I think there's a mistake in my initial approach because I assumed that sqrt(2) + sqrt(40) was larger, but in reality, sqrt(3"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two sums of square roots: sqrt(13) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(45) + sqrt(46). The question is asking which one is larger, and it wants the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots isn't straightforward because they can be tricky to manipulate algebraically. So, maybe squaring both sides could help. But before I jump into that, maybe I should actually compute approximate values of each expression to get a sense of which one is bigger. That might give me a rough idea or at least confirm whether one is definitely larger than the other.\n\nLet me start by estimating each square root:\n\n1. sqrt(13): I know that 3^2 = 9 and 4^2 = 16, so sqrt(13) is somewhere between 3 and 4. To get a better approximation, 3.6^2 = 12.96, which is very close to 13. So sqrt(13) ≈ 3.6055.\n\n2. sqrt(47): Similarly, 6^2 = 36 and 7^2 = 49, so sqrt(47) is between 6 and 7. Let's see, 6.8^2 = 46.24, which is just below 47. 6.9^2 = 47.61, which is above 47. So sqrt(47) is approximately 6.855.\n\n3. sqrt(45): That's a perfect square? Wait, 6^2 = 36, 7^2 = 49, so sqrt(45) is between 6 and 7. Let me compute 6.7^2 = 44.89, which is just below 45. 6.7^2 = 44.89, 6.72^2 = 45.1584. So sqrt(45) ≈ 6.7082.\n\n4. sqrt(46): Similarly, it's between 6 and 7. Let's see, 6.7^2 = 44.89, 6.72^2 = 45.1584, and 6.73^2 = 45.2929. Wait, that's actually not right because 6.73^2 is 6.73*6.73. Let me compute that properly:\n\n6.73 * 6.73: 6*6=36, 6*0.73=4.38, 0.73*6=4.38, 0.73*0.73≈0.5329. So adding all up: 36 + 4.38 + 4.38 + 0.5329 ≈ 36 + 8.76 + 0.5329 ≈ 45.2929. So sqrt(46) is slightly higher than 6.73, which is about 6.732.\n\nWait, but maybe I should use a better approximation method for sqrt(46). Alternatively, since I already have approximate values for sqrt(45) and sqrt(47), maybe I can use them to approximate the entire expressions.\n\nSo, let's write down the original expressions:\n\nA = sqrt(13) + sqrt(47) ≈ 3.6055 + 6.855 ≈ 10.4605\n\nB = sqrt(45) + sqrt(46) ≈ 6.7082 + 6.732 ≈ 13.4402\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right because sqrt(13) is about 3.6, sqrt(47) is about 6.85, so A is about 10.45. On the other hand, sqrt(45) is about 6.708, sqrt(46) is about 6.732, so B is about 13.440. So, according to this, B is larger than A. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because 45 and 46 are closer together than 13 and 47. Hmm, maybe my approximations are too rough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try squaring both expressions to see which is actually larger. Let's try that.\n\nCompute A^2 = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(47))^2 = 13 + 47 + 2*sqrt(13*47) = 60 + 2*sqrt(611). Similarly, compute B^2 = (sqrt(45) + sqrt(46))^2 = 45 + 46 + 2*sqrt(45*46) = 91 + 2*sqrt(2070).\n\nNow, let's compute the square roots:\n\nsqrt(611): 24^2 = 576, 25^2 = 625, so sqrt(611) is between 24 and 25. Let me see, 24.7^2 = 610.09, which is very close to 611. So sqrt(611) ≈ 24.715.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2070): 45^2 = 2025, 46^2 = 2116, so sqrt(2070) is between 45 and 46. Let's try 45.5^2 = 2070.25. Oh, that's very close. So sqrt(2070) ≈ 45.5 exactly.\n\nSo, plugging back into A^2:\n\nA^2 ≈ 60 + 2*24.715 ≈ 60 + 49.43 ≈ 109.43\n\nAnd B^2 ≈ 91 + 2*45.5 ≈ 91 + 91 ≈ 182\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 109.43 and B^2 ≈ 182. Therefore, since A^2 < B^2, that means A < B. So sqrt(13) + sqrt(47) is less than sqrt(45) + sqrt(46). So the larger number is sqrt(45) + sqrt(46).\n\nWait, let me recheck these calculations because earlier when I approximated sqrt(13) as 3.6055 and sqrt(47) as 6.855, adding them gives roughly 10.46. On the other hand, sqrt(45) is approximately 6.708 and sqrt(46) is approximately 6.732, adding them gives roughly 13.44. So, numerically, B is larger than A, as A^2 is approximately 109.43 and B^2 is approximately 182.\n\nBut wait, that seems a big difference. Maybe I should verify my approximations. Let me compute A^2 and B^2 more accurately.\n\nCompute A^2 = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(47))^2 = 13 + 47 + 2*sqrt(13*47) = 60 + 2*sqrt(611).\n\nCompute sqrt(611): Let's do a better approximation. I know that 24^2 = 576, 25^2 = 625. 611 - 576 = 35. So, let's see how much more than 24 is needed to get 611. Let's use linear approximation.\n\nLet’s denote x = 24 + d, such that (24 + d)^2 = 611. Then, 24^2 + 48d + d^2 = 611 => 576 + 48d + d^2 = 611 => 48d + d^2 = 35.\n\nAssuming d is small, d^2 is negligible compared to 48d, so approximately 48d ≈ 35 => d ≈ 35/48 ≈ 0.729. So, sqrt(611) ≈ 24.729. Let me compute 24.729^2: 24^2 = 576, 0.729^2 ≈ 0.531, and cross term 2*24*0.729 ≈ 34.992. So, total is 576 + 34.992 + 0.531 ≈ 611.523. Hmm, that's slightly over 611, so maybe d"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out which is larger: sqrt(15) + sqrt(48) or sqrt(35) + sqrt(39). Hmm, okay, let's see how I can approach this. I remember that sometimes when comparing square roots, squaring both numbers can help because it makes the comparison easier without having to deal with the square roots themselves. But I need to be careful because squaring can sometimes give a misleading result, especially if the numbers are close. \n\nLet me write down both expressions:\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(15) + sqrt(48)\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(35) + sqrt(39)\n\nI need to compare these two. Maybe I can compute both expressions numerically and then compare them. That sounds straightforward, but since sqrt(15), sqrt(48), sqrt(35), and sqrt(39) are all irrational numbers, their exact decimal values might not be easy to compute by hand. But maybe I can approximate them enough to compare.\n\nAlternatively, I can square both expressions and see which one is larger. Let me try both methods and see which is more accurate or efficient.\n\nFirst, let me try squaring the expressions.\n\nFor the first expression: [sqrt(15) + sqrt(48)]^2 = (sqrt(15))^2 + 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(48) + (sqrt(48))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(15))^2 = 15\n\n(sqrt(48))^2 = 48\n\nNow, the cross term: 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(48). Let's compute sqrt(15)*sqrt(48) first. Since sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab), so sqrt(15*48) = sqrt(720). Now, 720 is 144*5, so sqrt(720) = 12*sqrt(5). Therefore, 2*sqrt(720) = 24*sqrt(5). So the cross term is 24*sqrt(5).\n\nPutting it all together, the square of the first expression is 15 + 24*sqrt(5) + 48.\n\n15 + 48 is 63, so the square of the first expression is 63 + 24*sqrt(5).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the square of the second expression: [sqrt(35) + sqrt(39)]^2 = (sqrt(35))^2 + 2*sqrt(35)*sqrt(39) + (sqrt(39))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(35))^2 = 35\n\n(sqrt(39))^2 = 39\n\nCross term: 2*sqrt(35*39). Let's compute 35*39 first. 35*40 is 1400, subtract 35, so 1365. Therefore, sqrt(1365). Hmm, 1365 is not a perfect square, so we can’t simplify it further. Let's see if we can approximate sqrt(1365).\n\nI know that 37^2 is 1369, which is very close to 1365. So sqrt(1365) is approximately 37 - a tiny bit. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nLet’s denote x = sqrt(1365). We know that (37)^2 = 1369, so x = 37 - delta, where delta is a small positive number. Let's compute delta.\n\nx = 37 - delta\n\nx^2 = (37 - delta)^2 = 37^2 - 2*37*delta + delta^2 = 1369 - 74*delta + delta^2\n\nWe know that x^2 = 1365, so:\n\n1369 - 74*delta + delta^2 = 1365\n\nSimplify: 1369 - 1365 = 74*delta - delta^2\n\n4 = 74*delta - delta^2\n\nSince delta is small, delta^2 is negligible compared to 74*delta. So approximately:\n\n4 ≈ 74*delta => delta ≈ 4 /74 ≈ 0.054\n\nTherefore, x ≈ 37 - 0.054 = 36.946\n\nSo sqrt(1365) ≈ 36.946\n\nTherefore, the cross term 2*sqrt(1365) ≈ 2*36.946 ≈ 73.892\n\nTherefore, the square of the second expression: 35 + 39 + 73.892 = 74 + 73.892 = 147.892\n\nSo now, let me summarize:\n\nSquare of first expression: 63 + 24*sqrt(5)\n\nSquare of second expression: 147.892\n\nNow, I need to compute 24*sqrt(5) to see if it's less than 147.892 - 63 = 84.892.\n\nCompute sqrt(5): approximately 2.236\n\nTherefore, 24*2.236 ≈ 24*2 + 24*0.236 ≈ 48 + 5.664 ≈ 53.664\n\nTherefore, square of first expression: 63 + 53.664 ≈ 116.664\n\nSo, square of first expression ≈116.664, square of second expression ≈147.892\n\nSince 116.664 < 147.892, that means the first expression squared is less than the second expression squared. Therefore, the first expression is less than the second expression. So sqrt(15) + sqrt(48) < sqrt(35) + sqrt(39).\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(35) + sqrt(39). So the answer is sqrt(35) + sqrt(39).\n\nWait a minute, but just to make sure, maybe I should check the approximated square of the first expression, which was 116.664, versus 147.892. Yes, 116.664 is less than 147.892, so the first expression is indeed smaller. So the second expression is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if I had squared the second expression, which was larger, and got 147.892, which is greater than 116.664, that would also confirm that the second expression is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't approximate sqrt(5), perhaps I can compute 24*sqrt(5) more accurately.\n\nCompute sqrt(5) ≈ 2.2360679775\n\nSo 24*2.2360679775 ≈ 24*2.236068 ≈ 53.66565946\n\nSo 63 + 53.66565946 ≈ 116.66565946\n\nWhich is approximately 116.6657\n\nAnd 24*sqrt(5) is about 53.6657, so 63 + 53.6657 is indeed approximately 116.6657.\n\nAnd 147.892 is about 147.892, so 116.6657 is less than 147.892.\n\nTherefore, the square of the first expression is less than the square of the second, so the first expression is less than the second.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(15) + sqrt(48) < sqrt(35) + sqrt(39)\n\nSo the larger number is sqrt(35) + sqrt(39). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(35) + sqrt(39). So I need to write that in the box.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I should also try a different approach, perhaps by approximating the square roots individually and adding them.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(15):\n\n15 is between 9 (3^2) and 16 (4^2). So sqrt(15) is between 3 and 4.\n\nCompute 3.8^2 = 14.44; 3.9^2=15.21\n\nSo sqrt(15) is between 3.8 and 3.9.\n\nCompute 3.87^2: 3.87*3.87\n\nCompute 3*3=9, 3*0.87=2.61, 0.87*3=2.61, 0.87*0.87≈0.7569\n\nSo adding up: 9 + 2.61 +"

To compare A and B, I'll square both A and B and see which one is larger. If A^2 > B^2, then A > B, and vice versa. So, let's compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nStarting with A^2:\nA^2 = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(43))^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(43) + (sqrt(43))^2\nSimplify each term:\n= 2 + 2*sqrt(86) + 43\nCombine like terms:\n= 45 + 2*sqrt(86)\n\nNow, let's compute B^2:\nB^2 = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(37))^2 = (sqrt(6))^2 + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(37) + (sqrt(37))^2\nSimplify each term:\n= 6 + 2*sqrt(222) + 37\nCombine like terms:\n= 43 + 2*sqrt(222)\n\nSo, now I have A^2 = 45 + 2*sqrt(86) and B^2 = 43 + 2*sqrt(222).

If it is negative, then B^2 > A^2, and B > A.\n\nLet me approximate sqrt(86) and sqrt(222) to see their approximate values.\n\nFirst, sqrt(81) is 9, so sqrt(86) is a bit more than 9. Let's approximate it. 86 - 81 = 5, so sqrt(86) ≈ 9 + 5/(2*9) = 9 + 5/18 ≈ 9.2778.\n\nNext, sqrt(225) is 15, so sqrt(222) is a bit less than 15. Let's approximate it. 222 - 225 = -3, so sqrt(222) ≈ 15 - 3/(2*15) = 15 - 3/30 = 15 - 0.1 = 14.9.\n\nSo, sqrt(86) ≈ 9.2778 and sqrt(222) ≈ 14.9.\n\nNow, compute 1 + sqrt(86) - sqrt(222):\n= 1 + 9.2778 - 14.9\n= (1 + 9.2778) - 14.9\n= 10.2778 - 14.9\n= -4.6222\n\nSo, the result is approximately -4.6222, which is negative. Therefore, A^2 - B^2 ≈ -4.6222, which means A^2 < B^2. Since A^2 is less than B^2, that implies A < B.\n\nHence, sqrt(6) + sqrt(37) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(43). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(6) + sqrt(37), which I can write as sqrt(6) + sqrt(37).\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my approximations. Let me verify the approximate values again.\n\nsqrt(86): Since 9^2 = 81 and 10^2 = 100, so 9.2^2 = 84.64, 9.3^2 = 86.49. So, sqrt(86) is approximately 9.27, which is consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nsqrt(222): 14^2 = 196, 15^2 = 225. So, sqrt(222) is between 14 and 15. Let's compute 14.9^2: 14^2 = 196, 0.9^2 = 0.81, cross term 2*14*0.9 = 25.2, so total is 196 + 25.2 + 0.81 = 222.01. Wow, that's very close. So, sqrt(222) ≈ 14.9.\n\nThus, sqrt(86) ≈ 9.2778 and sqrt(222) ≈ 14.9, so 1 + sqrt(86) - sqrt(222) ≈ 1 + 9.2778 - 14.9 ≈ 10.2778 - 14.9 ≈ -4.6222, which is correct. So, A^2 - B^2 is negative, so A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(6) + sqrt(37) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(43).\n\nWait, just another thought: is there a way to verify this without approximating the square roots? Maybe by comparing the differences or something else?\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the differences between A and B. Suppose we compute A - B and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nA - B = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(43)) - (sqrt(6) + sqrt(37)) = (sqrt(43) - sqrt(37)) + (sqrt(2) - sqrt(6))\n\nNow, sqrt(43) - sqrt(37): Let's approximate this. sqrt(37) ≈ 6.08276, sqrt(43) ≈ 6.55743. So, their difference is about 0.47467.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142, sqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495. So, sqrt(2) - sqrt(6) ≈ -1.0353.\n\nTherefore, A - B ≈ 0.47467 - 1.0353 ≈ -0.5606, which is negative. Therefore, A - B is negative, so A < B.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that A < B, so B is larger. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(6) + sqrt(37).\n\nJust to make sure, let me check the approximate values of A and B.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(2) + sqrt(43) ≈ 1.4142 + 6.55743 ≈ 7.97163.\n\nCompute B = sqrt(6) + sqrt(37) ≈ 2.4495 + 6.08276 ≈ 8.53226.\n\nSo, A ≈ 7.97163 and B ≈ 8.53226, so indeed, B is larger.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that sqrt(6) + sqrt(37) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(43).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{37}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{43}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{37}\\), we square both expressions:\n\nLet \\(A = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{43}\\) and \\(B = \\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{37}\\).\n\nFirst, we compute \\(A^2\\):\n\\[\nA^2 = (\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{43})^2 = 2 + 2\\sqrt{86} + 43 = 45 + 2\\sqrt{86}\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute \\(B^2\\):\n\\[\nB^2 = (\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{37})^2 = 6 + 2\\sqrt{222} + 37 ="

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(25) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(30) + sqrt(34) or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Both expressions involve square roots, so maybe I can simplify them or compare them term by term.\n\nFirst, let me compute the numerical values to get a sense of their sizes. I know that sqrt(25) is 5 because 5 squared is 25. That one is straightforward. Now, sqrt(39) is a bit trickier. I know that 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(39) must be somewhere between 6 and 7. To approximate it, maybe I can do a linear approximation or just remember that 6.2 squared is 38.44, 6.3 squared is 39.69. So sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(30) is between 5 and 6. Since 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36, sqrt(30) is closer to 5. Let me calculate it. 5.5 squared is 30.25, which is just slightly above 30, so sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477.\n\nNow, sqrt(34) is between 5 and 6 as well. 5.8 squared is 33.64, and 5.9 squared is 34.81. So sqrt(34) is approximately 5.831.\n\nSo, let me summarize the approximate values:\n\nsqrt(25) = 5\n\nsqrt(39) ≈ 6.245\n\nsqrt(30) ≈ 5.477\n\nsqrt(34) ≈ 5.831\n\nSo the original expressions are:\n\nsqrt(25) + sqrt(39) ≈ 5 + 6.245 = 11.245\n\nsqrt(30) + sqrt(34) ≈ 5.477 + 5.831 = 11.308\n\nWait, so 11.245 vs. 11.308. So 11.308 is larger, which means sqrt(30) + sqrt(34) is larger than sqrt(25) + sqrt(39). Hmm, interesting.\n\nBut wait, I approximated the square roots, so I should check if my approximations are accurate enough or if I need a more precise method. Maybe squaring both sums would give a better comparison without having to calculate the square roots.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(25) + sqrt(39) and B = sqrt(30) + sqrt(34). I need to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square both A and B, I can compare A^2 and B^2. If A^2 > B^2, then A > B; if A^2 < B^2, then A < B.\n\nSo let me compute A^2 and B^2.\n\nFirst, A^2 = (sqrt(25) + sqrt(39))^2 = 25 + 2*sqrt(25*39) + 39 = 25 + 39 + 2*sqrt(975) = 64 + 2*sqrt(975).\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(30) + sqrt(34))^2 = 30 + 2*sqrt(30*34) + 34 = 30 + 34 + 2*sqrt(1020) = 64 + 2*sqrt(1020).\n\nSo now I have A^2 = 64 + 2*sqrt(975) and B^2 = 64 + 2*sqrt(1020). Since 64 is the same in both, we can compare sqrt(975) and sqrt(1020). Obviously, sqrt(1020) is larger than sqrt(975), so 2*sqrt(1020) is larger than 2*sqrt(975). Therefore, B^2 is larger than A^2, which means B > A.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier numerical approximation where B was about 11.308 and A was 11.245, so B is indeed larger. So my initial numerical approximation was correct.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the square roots again.\n\nsqrt(25) is definitely 5. sqrt(39): 6.245 squared is 38.990, which is just below 39, so sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245. Similarly, sqrt(34): 5.831 squared is 34. So that's correct.\n\nsqrt(30): 5.477 squared is 29.991, which is just below 30, so approximately 5.477. Similarly, sqrt(30) is around 5.477.\n\nSo, all my approximations seem accurate.\n\nBut let me just do a more precise calculation for sqrt(25) + sqrt(39) and sqrt(30) + sqrt(34).\n\nCompute sqrt(25) + sqrt(39):\n\n5 + 6.244998 = 11.244998\n\nCompute sqrt(30) + sqrt(34):\n\n5.477234 + 5.830952 = 11.308186\n\nSo, 11.244998 vs. 11.308186.\n\nYes, 11.308186 is larger. So sqrt(30) + sqrt(34) is larger than sqrt(25) + sqrt(39).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\" So, the expression with the larger value is sqrt(30) + sqrt(34). So I need to write that down.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in squaring the expressions, let me do that again.\n\nA = sqrt(25) + sqrt(39)\n\nA^2 = 25 + 2*sqrt(25*39) + 39 = 25 + 39 + 2*sqrt(975) = 64 + 2*sqrt(975)\n\nSimilarly, B = sqrt(30) + sqrt(34)\n\nB^2 = 30 + 2*sqrt(30*34) + 34 = 30 + 34 + 2*sqrt(1020) = 64 + 2*sqrt(1020)\n\nNow, since sqrt(1020) is greater than sqrt(975), 2*sqrt(1020) is greater than 2*sqrt(975). Therefore, B^2 > A^2, so B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(30) + sqrt(34) is larger than sqrt(25) + sqrt(39).\n\nSo, the answer is sqrt(30) + sqrt(34), which is written as \\boxed{\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{34}}.\n\nWait, but just to ensure, let me compute the exact differences.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(25) + sqrt(39) = 5 + sqrt(39) ≈ 5 + 6.245 = 11.245\n\nCompute B = sqrt(30) + sqrt(34) ≈ 5.477 + 5.831 ≈ 11.308\n\nDifference is 11.308 - 11.245 ≈ 0.063, which is positive, so B is larger.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the difference of squares:\n\nB^2 - A^2 = (64 + 2*sqrt(1020)) - (64 + 2*sqrt(975)) = 2*(sqrt(1020) - sqrt(975))\n\nSince sqrt(1020) > sqrt(975), this difference is positive, so B^2 > A^2, so B > A.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the two sums numerically with more precision.\n\nCompute sqrt(25) + sqrt(39):\n\nsqrt(25) is 5.\n\nsqrt(39): 6.244998436\n\nSo 5 + 6.244998436 = 11.244998436\n\nCompute sqrt(30) + sqrt(34):\n\nsqrt(30): 5.477234384\n\nsqrt(34): 5.830951895\n\nAdding them: 5."

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots isn't straightforward because the square roots can be irrational numbers. So, adding them together might not give me a clear answer. Maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare? That sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me write down both expressions:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(5) + sqrt(44)\n\nExpression B: sqrt(16) + sqrt(39)\n\nI need to figure out whether A is greater than B or vice versa.

Hmm, which one is bigger? Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's compute the approximate values of sqrt(220) and sqrt(624) to see how much we're adding.\n\nCalculating sqrt(220):\n\nI know that 14^2 = 196 and 15^2 = 225, so sqrt(220) is just a little less than 15. Let me approximate it.\n\n14.8^2 = (14 + 0.8)^2 = 14^2 + 2 * 14 * 0.8 + 0.8^2 = 196 + 22.4 + 0.64 = 219.04\n\nHmm, that's pretty close. So, sqrt(220) ≈ 14.832\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(624):\n\nI know that 24^2 = 576 and 25^2 = 625, so sqrt(624) is just a little less than 25.\n\nLet me see:\n\n24.99^2 = (25 - 0.01)^2 = 25^2 - 2 * 25 * 0.01 + 0.01^2 = 625 - 0.5 + 0.0001 = 624.5001\n\nSo, sqrt(624) is approximately 24.98, because 24.99^2 is 624.5001, which is just a bit over 624, so sqrt(624) is approximately 24.98.\n\nSo, now let's plug these approximate values back into (A)^2 and (B)^2.\n\n(A)^2 ≈ 49 + 2 * 14.832 = 49 + 29.664 = 78.664\n\n(B)^2 ≈ 55 + 2 * 24.98 = 55 + 49.96 = 104.96\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right.\n\nWait, sqrt(624) is approximately 24.98, so 2 * sqrt(624) is approximately 49.96.\n\nSo, (B)^2 = 55 + 49.96 = 104.96\n\nAnd (A)^2 is approximately 49 + 29.664 = 78.664\n\nSo, comparing 78.664 and 104.96, it's clear that 104.96 is larger. Therefore, (B)^2 is larger than (A)^2, which means that B is larger than A.\n\nSo, Expression B: sqrt(16) + sqrt(39) is larger than Expression A: sqrt(5) + sqrt(44).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me verify the approximations because 24.98 seems a bit low.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(624) more accurately.\n\nWe know that 24^2 = 576\n\n24.9^2 = (24 + 0.9)^2 = 24^2 + 2 * 24 * 0.9 + 0.9^2 = 576 + 43.2 + 0.81 = 619.01\n\n24.95^2 = (24 + 0.95)^2 = 24^2 + 2 * 24 * 0.95 + 0.95^2 = 576 + 45.6 + 0.9025 = 622.5025\n\n24.98^2 = (24.95 + 0.03)^2 = 24.95^2 + 2 * 24.95 * 0.03 + 0.03^2 = 622.5025 + 1.497 + 0.0009 = 624.0\n\nWait, 24.98^2 is exactly 624.0?

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(11) + sqrt(48) and sqrt(31) + sqrt(43). Hmm, both expressions involve square roots, and I have to figure out which one is larger. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can calculate the approximate values of each expression and then compare them. That seems straightforward, but I have to be careful with the square roots because they might not be exact integers. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, sqrt(11). I know that 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16, so sqrt(11) must be somewhere between 3 and 4. To get a better estimate, I can remember that 3.3 squared is 10.89, and 3.4 squared is 11.56. So, sqrt(11) is approximately 3.3166. Let me write that down: sqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166.\n\nNext, sqrt(48). Hmm, 48 is between 36 and 64, so sqrt(48) is between 6 and 8. To get a better estimate, I know that 6.9 squared is 47.61, and 7 squared is 49. So, sqrt(48) is a bit less than 6.9, maybe around 6.9282. Let me note that: sqrt(48) ≈ 6.9282.\n\nAdding them together: sqrt(11) + sqrt(48) ≈ 3.3166 + 6.9282. Let me add those numbers: 3.3166 + 6.9282. 3 + 6 is 9, and 0.3166 + 0.9282 is approximately 1.2448. So, total is roughly 10.2448. Okay, so the first expression is approximately 10.2448.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(31) + sqrt(43). Let's start with sqrt(31). I know that 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36, so sqrt(31) is between 5 and 6. Let me check 5.5 squared: 5.5 * 5.5 is 30.25. So, 5.5 squared is 30.25, which is just below 31. Therefore, sqrt(31) is a bit more than 5.5. Let me try 5.54 squared: 5.54 * 5.54. Let me compute that.\n\n5 * 5 = 25, 5 * 0.54 = 2.7, 0.54 * 5 = 2.7, and 0.54 * 0.54 is 0.2916. So, adding up all these: 25 + 2.7 + 2.7 + 0.2916 = 30.6916. Hmm, 5.54 squared is 30.6916, which is still less than 31. Let me try 5.55 squared.\n\n5.55 squared: 5 + 0.55, so (5 + 0.55)^2 = 5^2 + 2*5*0.55 + 0.55^2 = 25 + 5.5 + 0.3025 = 30.8025. Still less than 31. Next, 5.56 squared: 5.56^2.\n\n5.5^2 is 30.25, as before. 5.56 is 5.5 + 0.06, so (5.5 + 0.06)^2 = 5.5^2 + 2*5.5*0.06 + 0.06^2 = 30.25 + 0.66 + 0.0036 = 30.9136. Still below 31.\n\nNext, 5.57 squared: 5.57^2. 5.57 is 5.5 + 0.07. So, (5.5 + 0.07)^2 = 5.5^2 + 2*5.5*0.07 + 0.07^2 = 30.25 + 0.77 + 0.0049 = 31.0249. Oh, that's above 31. So, sqrt(31) is between 5.56 and 5.57. Let me find a better approximation.\n\nBetween 5.56 and 5.57, the square went from 30.9136 to 31.0249. The difference between 5.56 and 5.57 is 0.01, and the difference in squares is 31.0249 - 30.9136 = 0.1113. We need to increase from 30.9136 to 31, which is 0.0864. So, the fraction is 0.0864 / 0.1113 ≈ 0.776. Therefore, sqrt(31) is approximately 5.56 + 0.776*0.01 ≈ 5.5678. Let me note that: sqrt(31) ≈ 5.5678.\n\nNow, sqrt(43). Hmm, 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(43) is between 6 and 7. Let me see: 6.5 squared is 42.25, which is very close to 43. So, sqrt(43) is just a bit more than 6.5. Let me compute 6.5 squared: 6.5 * 6.5 is 42.25. Then, 6.51 squared: 6.5 + 0.01, so (6.5 + 0.01)^2 = 6.5^2 + 2*6.5*0.01 + 0.01^2 = 42.25 + 0.13 + 0.0001 = 42.3801.\n\nStill less than 43. Let me try 6.52 squared: 6.52 is 6.5 + 0.02, so (6.5 + 0.02)^2 = 6.5^2 + 2*6.5*0.02 + 0.02^2 = 42.25 + 0.26 + 0.0004 = 42.5104.\n\nStill less than 43. Next, 6.53 squared: 6.53 is 6.5 + 0.03, so (6.5 + 0.03)^2 = 6.5^2 + 2*6.5*0.03 + 0.03^2 = 42.25 + 0.39 + 0.0009 = 42.6409.\n\nStill less than 43. Next, 6.54 squared: 6.54 is 6.5 + 0.04, so (6.5 + 0.04)^2 = 6.5^2 + 2*6.5*0.04 + 0.04^2 = 42.25 + 0.52 + 0.0016 = 42.7716.\n\nStill less than 43. Next, 6.55 squared: 6.55 is 6.5 + 0.05, so (6.5 + 0.05)^2 = 6.5^2 + 2*6.5*0.05 + 0.05^2 = 42.25 + 0.65 + 0.0025 = 42.9025.\n\nStill less than 43. Next, 6.56 squared: 6.56 is 6.5 + 0.06, so (6.5 + 0.06)^2 = 6.5^2 + 2*6.5*0.06 + 0.06^2 = 42.25 + 0.78 + 0.0036 = 43.0336.\n\nAh, there we go. So, 6.56 squared is 43.0336, which is just a bit above 43."

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(3) + sqrt(26) is larger than sqrt(15) + sqrt(21) or vice versa. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both expressions can help because it can make things easier to handle. But I also remember that squaring might not always be straightforward because it can sometimes introduce extra complexities or make things less clear. Hmm, I need to think about this.\n\nFirst, let me write down both expressions:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(3) + sqrt(26)\n\nExpression B: sqrt(15) + sqrt(21)\n\nI want to compare A and B. Maybe I can square both expressions and then compare the results. That might help me determine which one is larger. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I square A: (sqrt(3) + sqrt(26))^2.\n\nExpanding this, it should be (sqrt(3))^2 + 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(26) + (sqrt(26))^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(3))^2 = 3\n\n(sqrt(26))^2 = 26\n\nAnd the cross term: 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(26) = 2*sqrt(78). Hmm, sqrt(78) is approximately 8.83, so 2*8.83 is about 17.66.\n\nSo adding all together: 3 + 17.66 + 26 = 46.66 approximately.\n\nWait, let me do exact calculations instead of approximations to make it precise. 3 + 26 is 29, plus 17.66 is 46.66. So, (sqrt(3) + sqrt(26))^2 = 29 + 2*sqrt(78). Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, let's square expression B: (sqrt(15) + sqrt(21))^2.\n\nSimilarly, expanding this:\n\n(sqrt(15))^2 + 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(21) + (sqrt(21))^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(15))^2 = 15\n\n(sqrt(21))^2 = 21\n\nCross term: 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(21) = 2*sqrt(315). Hmm, sqrt(315) is sqrt(9*35) which is 3*sqrt(35). So 2*3*sqrt(35) is 6*sqrt(35). Hmm, approximately sqrt(35) is about 5.916, so 6*5.916 is about 35.496.\n\nSo adding all together: 15 + 35.496 + 21. 15 + 21 is 36, plus 35.496 is 71.496. So (sqrt(15) + sqrt(21))^2 is approximately 71.496.\n\nWait, let me confirm the exact value. 15 + 21 is 36. 36 + 2*sqrt(315). So, 36 + 2*sqrt(315). Hmm, 315 is 9*35, so sqrt(315) is 3*sqrt(35). So 2*3*sqrt(35) is 6*sqrt(35). So, yeah, 36 + 6*sqrt(35). So, exact value is 36 + 6*sqrt(35). Wait, but in my approximate calculation earlier, I got 71.496.\n\nWait, let me check: 6*sqrt(35). sqrt(35) is approximately 5.916, so 6*5.916 is about 35.496. Then 36 + 35.496 is 71.496. So that seems accurate.\n\nSo, now, A squared is approximately 46.66 and B squared is approximately 71.496. Since 71.496 is larger than 46.66, that means that B is larger than A. Therefore, sqrt(15) + sqrt(21) is larger than sqrt(3) + sqrt(26).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my approximations because sometimes approximate values can be misleading. Let me try to compute the exact values more precisely.\n\nFirst, let's compute sqrt(78). sqrt(64) is 8, sqrt(81) is 9, so sqrt(78) is somewhere around 8.83. Let me calculate sqrt(78) more precisely.\n\nUsing linear approximation: Let x = 78. We know that 8^2 = 64, 9^2 = 81. The difference is 5. So, the derivative of sqrt(x) at x=64 is (1)/(2*8) = 1/16. So, sqrt(78) ≈ sqrt(64) + (1/16)*(78-64) = 8 + (1/16)*14 = 8 + 0.875 = 8.875.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(35): Let's compute it. 5^2 = 25, 6^2 = 36. sqrt(35) is between 5.9 and 6. Let's compute sqrt(35). 5.9^2 = 34.81, 5.91^2 ≈ 34.9281, 5.92^2 ≈ 35.0464. So sqrt(35) ≈ 5.916.\n\nTherefore, 6*sqrt(35) ≈ 6*5.916 ≈ 35.496.\n\nSo, 36 + 35.496 = 71.496.\n\nSimilarly, for sqrt(78), earlier I approximated it as 8.875, but in reality, sqrt(78) is a bit more precise. Let me calculate it using linear approximation again.\n\nsqrt(78): Let x = 78, a = 64, so the derivative is (1)/(2*8) = 1/16, as before. So, sqrt(78) ≈ sqrt(64) + (78 - 64)/16 = 8 + 14/16 = 8.875. To get a better approximation, let's compute (8.875)^2.\n\n8.875^2 = (8 + 0.875)^2 = 8^2 + 2*8*0.875 + 0.875^2 = 64 + 14 + 0.765625 = 78.765625. That's higher than 78. So, 8.875 squared is 78.765625, which is 0.765625 more than 78. So, we can adjust our approximation.\n\nLet me let f(x) = x^2, and we know that f(8.875) = 78.765625. We want to find x such that f(x) = 78. So, the linear approximation: delta_x ≈ (78 - 78.765625)/(2*f(x)).\n\nWait, actually, it's better to use the Newton-Raphson method. Let's try that.\n\nLet x0 = 8.875, f(x0) = 78.765625, f'(x0) = 2*x0 = 17.75.\n\nWe want to find x such that f(x) = 78. So, delta_x ≈ (78 - 78.765625)/17.75 ≈ (-0.765625)/17.75 ≈ -0.0431.\n\nSo, x ≈ x0 + delta_x ≈ 8.875 - 0.0431 ≈ 8.8319.\n\nLet's compute f(8.8319) = (8.8319)^2. 8.8^2 = 77.44, 8.83^2 = (8.8 + 0.03)^2 = 8.8^2 + 2*8.8*0.03 + 0.03^2 = 77.44 + 0.528 + 0.0009 = 77.9689.\n\nWait, 8.8319^2: let's compute 8.8319 * 8.8319.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n8 * 8 = 64\n\n8 * 0.83"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(3) + sqrt(38) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(28), or vice versa. Hmm, how do I compare these sums of square roots? I remember that sometimes you can square both expressions to make them easier to compare, but I have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions or make things more complicated. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's denote A = sqrt(3) + sqrt(38) and B = sqrt(6) + sqrt(28). I want to compare A and B. Since both A and B are sums of square roots, squaring them might help. Let me compute A² and B² and then compare those.\n\nStarting with A²:\n\nA² = (sqrt(3) + sqrt(38))² = (sqrt(3))² + 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(38) + (sqrt(38))² = 3 + 2*sqrt(114) + 38.\n\nSimplifying that, 3 + 38 is 41, so A² = 41 + 2*sqrt(114).\n\nNow, for B²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(28))² = (sqrt(6))² + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))² = 6 + 2*sqrt(168) + 28.\n\nAgain, 6 + 28 is 34, so B² = 34 + 2*sqrt(168).\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B². That is, compare 41 + 2*sqrt(114) and 34 + 2*sqrt(168). Let me write that down:\n\n41 + 2*sqrt(114) vs. 34 + 2*sqrt(168).\n\nTo compare these, maybe I can subtract the smaller constant from both sides first. So, subtract 34 from both:\n\n(41 - 34) + 2*sqrt(114) vs. 0 + 2*sqrt(168).\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n7 + 2*sqrt(114) vs. 2*sqrt(168).\n\nNow, let me see if 7 + 2*sqrt(114) is greater than 2*sqrt(168). Alternatively, I can divide both sides by 2 to simplify. Let's try that:\n\n(7)/2 + sqrt(114) vs. sqrt(168).\n\nCalculating 7/2 is 3.5, so now we have:\n\n3.5 + sqrt(114) vs. sqrt(168).\n\nHmm, sqrt(168) is a bit tricky. Let me compute its approximate value. Since 12² is 144 and 13² is 169, sqrt(168) is just slightly less than 13, maybe approximately 12.96.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(114) is between 10²=100 and 11²=121, so it's around 10.68.\n\nSo, 3.5 + 10.68 ≈ 14.18, and sqrt(168) ≈ 12.96.\n\nSo, 14.18 vs. 12.96. Clearly, 14.18 is greater. Therefore, 3.5 + sqrt(114) is greater than sqrt(168). So, the original comparison is A² > B², which implies A > B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, A²: 3 + 38 = 41, correct. 2*sqrt(114), correct.\n\nB²: 6 + 28 = 34, correct. 2*sqrt(168), correct.\n\nSubtracting 34 from both sides: 7 + 2*sqrt(114) vs. 2*sqrt(168). Correct.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 3.5 + sqrt(114) vs. sqrt(168). Correct.\n\nCalculating approximate values:\n\nsqrt(114) ≈ 10.68, so 3.5 + 10.68 ≈ 14.18.\n\nsqrt(168) ≈ 12.96.\n\nSo yes, 14.18 > 12.96, so A² > B², so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(3) + sqrt(38) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(28).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe I can approximate both sums numerically and see which one is larger.\n\nCalculating sqrt(3): approximately 1.732.\n\nCalculating sqrt(38): sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(38) is a bit more, maybe 6.164.\n\nSo, A = 1.732 + 6.164 ≈ 7.896.\n\nCalculating sqrt(6): approximately 2.449.\n\nCalculating sqrt(28): sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(28) is a bit more, maybe 5.291.\n\nSo, B = 2.449 + 5.291 ≈ 7.740.\n\nComparing the two: A ≈ 7.896 and B ≈ 7.740. So yes, A is larger.\n\nHmm, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the difference between A and B. If A is sqrt(3) + sqrt(38) and B is sqrt(6) + sqrt(28), maybe I can compute A - B and see if it's positive.\n\nCompute A - B = sqrt(3) + sqrt(38) - sqrt(6) - sqrt(28). Let me see if this can be expressed as some combination or if it's positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can group terms: (sqrt(38) - sqrt(28)) + (sqrt(3) - sqrt(6)).\n\nCompute sqrt(38) - sqrt(28): sqrt(38) ≈ 6.164, sqrt(28) ≈ 5.291, so difference ≈ 0.873.\n\nCompute sqrt(3) - sqrt(6): sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, so difference ≈ -0.717.\n\nSo, A - B ≈ 0.873 - 0.717 ≈ 0.156. Positive. Therefore, A is larger than B.\n\nThat's another method, grouping the terms, and calculating the approximate difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can also compute the squares more precisely, not just approximately.\n\nLet me compute A² and B² more accurately:\n\nA²: 41 + 2*sqrt(114). Let's compute sqrt(114):\n\n114 is between 100 and 121, so sqrt(114) is between 10 and 11. Let's compute 10.6²: 10.6*10.6 = 112.36. 10.7² = 114.49. So sqrt(114) is between 10.6 and 10.7.\n\nCompute 10.6² = 112.36, so 114 - 112.36 = 1.64. So, linear approximation: sqrt(114) ≈ 10.6 + (1.64)/(2*10.6) ≈ 10.6 + (1.64)/21.2 ≈ 10.6 + 0.077 ≈ 10.677.\n\nSo, sqrt(114) ≈ 10.677. Then, 2*sqrt(114) ≈ 21.354. So, A² ≈ 41 + 21.354 ≈ 62.354.\n\nNow, B²: 34 + 2*sqrt(168). Compute sqrt(168):\n\n168 is between 169 and 144, so sqrt(168) is between 12 and 13. Let's try 12.9²: 12.9*12.9 = 166.41. 12.95²: 12.95*12.95 = (13 - 0.05)² = 169 - 2*13*0.05 + 0.05² = 169 - 1"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to compare sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(3) + sqrt(42). Hmm, okay. Let me write them down separately to get a clear picture.\n\nFirst, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, and sqrt(49) is 7 because 7 squared is 49. So, adding those together, sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) is roughly 1.4142 + 7, which equals 8.4142.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(3) + sqrt(42). Let me calculate each part. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, and sqrt(42) is a bit trickier. Let me see, 6 squared is 36, and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(42) should be somewhere between 6 and 7. Maybe around 6.4807? Let me check: 6.4807 squared is (6 + 0.4807)^2 = 6^2 + 2*6*0.4807 + (0.4807)^2 = 36 + 5.7684 + 0.2311 ≈ 36 + 5.7684 + 0.2311 ≈ 41.9995, which is very close to 42. So, sqrt(42) ≈ 6.4807.\n\nAdding that to sqrt(3), which is about 1.732, so 1.732 + 6.4807 ≈ 8.2127.\n\nWait a second, so sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) is approximately 8.4142, and sqrt(3) + sqrt(42) is approximately 8.2127. So, 8.4142 is larger than 8.2127. Therefore, sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) is larger.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Maybe I should do the calculations more precisely.\n\nCalculating sqrt(2) + sqrt(49):\n\nsqrt(2) ≈ 1.41421356\n\nsqrt(49) = 7 exactly.\n\nSo, 1.41421356 + 7 = 8.41421356.\n\nNow, sqrt(3) + sqrt(42):\n\nsqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205081\n\nsqrt(42): Let me calculate it more accurately. sqrt(42) is between 6 and 7, as I thought earlier. Let me compute 6.4807^2: 6.4807 * 6.4807.\n\nFirst, 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n6 * 0.4807 = 2.8842\n\n0.4807 * 6 = 2.8842\n\n0.4807 * 0.4807 ≈ 0.2311\n\nAdding those up:\n\n36 + 2.8842 + 2.8842 + 0.2311 ≈ 36 + 5.7684 + 0.2311 ≈ 41.9995, which is 42 when rounded. So, sqrt(42) ≈ 6.4807406984.\n\nNow, adding sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205081 + 6.4807406984 ≈ 8.212791508.\n\nComparing the two results: 8.41421356 vs. 8.212791508. So, 8.4142 is indeed larger than 8.2127. Therefore, sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) is larger.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a way to compare these without approximating? Maybe by squaring both expressions? Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(2) + sqrt(49), so A = sqrt(2) + 7.\n\nSimilarly, B = sqrt(3) + sqrt(42).\n\nSo, A = sqrt(2) + 7, and B = sqrt(3) + sqrt(42). I can square both A and B to see which is larger.\n\nCompute A^2 = (sqrt(2) + 7)^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*7 + 7^2 = 2 + 14*sqrt(2) + 49 = 51 + 14*sqrt(2).\n\nSimilarly, compute B^2 = (sqrt(3) + sqrt(42))^2 = (sqrt(3))^2 + 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))^2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(126) + 42 = 45 + 2*sqrt(126).\n\nNow, we need to compare A^2 and B^2: 51 + 14*sqrt(2) vs. 45 + 2*sqrt(126).\n\nFirst, compute the difference: (51 + 14*sqrt(2)) - (45 + 2*sqrt(126)) = 6 + 14*sqrt(2) - 2*sqrt(126).\n\nSimplify this: 6 + 14*sqrt(2) - 2*sqrt(126).\n\nFactor out a 2: 6 + 2*(7*sqrt(2) - sqrt(126)).\n\nNow, compute 7*sqrt(2) and sqrt(126):\n\n7*sqrt(2) ≈ 7*1.4142 ≈ 9.8994\n\nsqrt(126) ≈ 11.2250\n\nSo, 7*sqrt(2) - sqrt(126) ≈ 9.8994 - 11.2250 ≈ -1.3256\n\nMultiply by 2: 2*(-1.3256) ≈ -2.6512\n\nAdd 6: 6 - 2.6512 ≈ 3.3488\n\nSo, the difference A^2 - B^2 ≈ 3.3488, which is positive. Therefore, A^2 > B^2, so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(3) + sqrt(42).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me also try to compare sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(3) + sqrt(42) without squaring, but just by estimation.\n\nWe know that sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, sqrt(49)=7, so sqrt(2) + sqrt(49) ≈ 8.414.\n\nOn the other hand, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(42) ≈ 6.480, so sqrt(3) + sqrt(42) ≈ 8.212.\n\nSo, 8.414 vs. 8.212, definitely 8.414 is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see how much each term contributes.\n\nIn sqrt(2) + sqrt(49), sqrt(49) is the dominant term because it's 7, whereas in sqrt(3) + sqrt(42), sqrt(42) is about 6.48, which is a bit less than 7, and sqrt(3) is only about 1.732.\n\nSo, sqrt(49) is 7, whereas sqrt(42) is about 6.48, which is 0.52 less than 7. But sqrt(3) is about 1.732, which is about a third less than sqrt(42) maybe? Wait, not exactly. sqrt(3) is about 1.732, which is about 0.268 less than 2, but not directly related.\n\nWait, maybe I can see the difference between sqrt(49) and sqrt(42):\n\nsqrt(49) is 7, sqrt(42) is approximately 6.4807, so the difference is about 0.5193.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, which is less than sqrt(42) by about 0.268.\n\nSo, sqrt(49) is significantly larger than sqrt(42), so when we add sqrt(49) to sqrt(2), which is a larger number, it's going to make the total sum larger.\n\nWhereas, sqrt(3) is a smaller number,"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(1) + sqrt(36) is larger than sqrt(20) + sqrt(26) or not. Hmm, let me start by calculating each of these square roots individually to see what they equal.\n\nFirst, sqrt(1). I remember that the square root of 1 is 1 because 1 multiplied by 1 is 1. So, sqrt(1) = 1. That part is straightforward.\n\nNext, sqrt(36). I think that's a number that when multiplied by itself gives 36. Let me think… 6 times 6 is 36, so sqrt(36) should be 6. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, adding those together: sqrt(1) + sqrt(36) = 1 + 6 = 7. Okay, so that sum is 7.\n\nNow, the other part is sqrt(20) + sqrt(26). Hmm, I need to figure these out. Let me see if I can simplify sqrt(20) and sqrt(26) or maybe approximate their values.\n\nStarting with sqrt(20). I know that 20 is between 16 (which is 4 squared) and 25 (which is 5 squared). Since 20 is closer to 25, I think sqrt(20) is somewhere between 4 and 5. Maybe I can calculate it more precisely. Let me try.\n\nI remember that sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(20) should be a bit more than 4. Let me see if I can find a better approximation. Maybe I can use the fact that (4 + 1/4)^2 is 4.25 squared. Let me compute that.\n\n4.25 squared is (4 + 0.25)^2 = 4^2 + 2*4*0.25 + 0.25^2 = 16 + 2 + 0.0625 = 18.0625. Hmm, that's less than 20.\n\nLet me try 4.4 squared. 4.4 * 4.4 is 19.36. Still less than 20.\n\n4.5 squared is 20.25. Ah, that's more than 20. So, sqrt(20) is between 4.4 and 4.5. Let me narrow it down.\n\n4.4 squared is 19.36, and 4.5 is 20.25. So, 20 is 0.64 units above 19.36. The difference between 19.36 and 20.25 is 0.89. So, 0.64 / 0.89 is roughly 0.71. So, sqrt(20) is approximately 4.4 + 0.71*(0.1) = 4.4 + 0.071 = 4.471. So, about 4.47. Let me verify that.\n\n4.47 squared: 4 * 4 = 16, 4 * 0.47 = 1.88, 0.47 * 4 = 1.88, and 0.47 * 0.47 is about 0.2209. So, adding those up: 16 + 1.88 + 1.88 + 0.2209 = 16 + 3.76 + 0.2209 ≈ 19.9809. That's about 20. So, sqrt(20) ≈ 4.472.\n\nAlright, so sqrt(20) is approximately 4.472.\n\nNow, moving on to sqrt(26). Let's see. 25 is 5 squared, so sqrt(25) is 5. 26 is just 1 more than 25, so sqrt(26) should be a little more than 5. Let's approximate it.\n\nAgain, I can use linear approximation. Let me take f(x) = sqrt(x). Then, f'(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)). So, the tangent line at x=25 is f(25) + f'(25)*(x - 25). So, f(26) ≈ 5 + (1/(2*5))*(1) = 5 + 0.1 = 5.1.\n\nLet me check that: 5.1 squared is 26.01. Oh, that's very close. So, sqrt(26) is approximately 5.099.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 5.099 squared is 5.099*5.099. Let me compute that:\n\n5*5 = 25, 5*0.099 = 0.495, 0.099*5 = 0.495, and 0.099*0.099 ≈ 0.009801.\n\nAdding them up: 25 + 0.495 + 0.495 + 0.009801 ≈ 25 + 0.99 + 0.009801 ≈ 25.999801. So, that's approximately 26. So, sqrt(26) is approximately 5.099.\n\nOkay, so sqrt(26) ≈ 5.099.\n\nWait, but earlier when I approximated sqrt(20), I got about 4.472. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 4.472 squared is approximately 20.00, as I did earlier. So, that seems accurate.\n\nSo, sqrt(20) ≈ 4.472, and sqrt(26) ≈ 5.099.\n\nAdding those together: 4.472 + 5.099 ≈ 9.571.\n\nSo, sqrt(20) + sqrt(26) ≈ 9.571.\n\nEarlier, sqrt(1) + sqrt(36) was 7. So, 7 is clearly less than 9.571.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(20) + sqrt(26) is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(36).\n\nBut, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my approximations, let me consider another approach. Maybe squaring both sums to compare them.\n\nSo, if I square sqrt(1) + sqrt(36), that's (1 + 6)^2 = 7^2 = 49.\n\nOn the other hand, if I square sqrt(20) + sqrt(26), that's (sqrt(20) + sqrt(26))^2 = 20 + 2*sqrt(20*26) + 26 = 46 + 2*sqrt(520).\n\nNow, sqrt(520) is sqrt(4*130) = 2*sqrt(130). So, 2*sqrt(520) = 2*(2*sqrt(130)) = 4*sqrt(130).\n\nSo, altogether, that's 46 + 4*sqrt(130). Now, sqrt(130) is approximately 11.401, so 4*sqrt(130) ≈ 45.604. So, 46 + 45.604 ≈ 91.604.\n\nTherefore, (sqrt(20) + sqrt(26))^2 ≈ 91.604, which is much larger than 49, the square of 7.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(20) + sqrt(26) is indeed larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(36). So, the larger number is sqrt(20) + sqrt(26).\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me see if my approximations are correct.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(20) as approximately 4.4721, and sqrt(26) as approximately 5.0990. Adding those together: 4.4721 + 5.0990 = 9.5711.\n\nAnd sqrt(1) + sqrt(36) is 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nSo, 9.5711 is clearly larger than 7.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the fact that sqrt(20) is about 4.47 and sqrt(26) is about 5.09, adding those gives roughly 9.57, which is way more than 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the distances from 1 and 36.\n\nWait, sqrt(1) is 1, which is 0 away from 1, and sqrt(36) is 6, which is 5 away from 1. So, 1 + "

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which is larger between sqrt(4) + sqrt(37) and sqrt(6) + sqrt(16). Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, maybe I should compute each of these square roots individually to see what numbers I'm dealing with. \n\nStarting with sqrt(4). I know that 2 times 2 is 4, so sqrt(4) must be 2. That was straightforward.\n\nNext, sqrt(37). Hmm, 37 isn't a perfect square, so I'll need to estimate it. I know that 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(37) is somewhere between 6 and 7. To get a better approximation, let me see how close 37 is to 36. 37 is just 1 more than 36, so sqrt(37) should be a little over 6. Maybe around 6.08? Let me check: 6.08 squared is approximately 37.0, right? Yeah, that seems about right. So sqrt(37) ≈ 6.08.\n\nMoving on to sqrt(6). Similarly, 6 isn't a perfect square either, so I'll estimate this. I know that 2 squared is 4 and 3 squared is 9, so sqrt(6) is between 2 and 3. Let me try 2.4 squared: 2.4 times 2.4 is 5.76. That's a bit less than 6, so let me try 2.45 squared. 2.45 times 2.45 is... let's see, 2 times 2 is 4, 2 times 0.45 is 0.9, 0.45 times 2 is another 0.9, and 0.45 times 0.45 is 0.2025. Adding those up: 4 + 0.9 + 0.9 + 0.2025 = 6.0025. Wow, that's really close to 6. So sqrt(6) is approximately 2.45.\n\nLastly, sqrt(16). That's easy since 4 times 4 is 16, so sqrt(16) is 4. Perfect, that doesn't need any approximation.\n\nSo now, let me write down all these approximated values:\n\n- sqrt(4) = 2\n- sqrt(37) ≈ 6.08\n- sqrt(6) ≈ 2.45\n- sqrt(16) = 4\n\nNow, let's compute each of the sums.\n\nFirst sum: sqrt(4) + sqrt(37) = 2 + 6.08 = 8.08.\n\nSecond sum: sqrt(6) + sqrt(16) = 2.45 + 4 = 6.45.\n\nComparing 8.08 and 6.45, clearly 8.08 is larger. Therefore, sqrt(4) + sqrt(37) is the larger number.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my approximations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor sqrt(37): 6.08 squared is 6.08 * 6.08. Let me compute this:\n\n6 * 6 = 36\n\n6 * 0.08 = 0.48\n\n0.08 * 6 = 0.48\n\n0.08 * 0.08 = 0.0064\n\nAdding them up: 36 + 0.48 + 0.48 + 0.0064 = 36 + 0.96 + 0.0064 = 36.9664.\n\nWait, that's 36.9664, which is 36.9664, which is less than 37. So, my initial estimate of 6.08 was a bit low. Hmm, so I need a better approximation.\n\nI know that 6.08 squared is 36.9664, which is 0.0336 less than 37. So, how much more do I need to add to 6.08 to get to sqrt(37)?\n\nLet me use linear approximation. The derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2*sqrt(x)). So, at x = 36.9664, the derivative is 1/(2*6.08) ≈ 1/12.16 ≈ 0.0822.\n\nSo, to increase sqrt(x) by 0.0336, I need to increase x by approximately 0.0822 * 0.0336 ≈ 0.00276.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(37) ≈ 6.08 + 0.00276 ≈ 6.0828.\n\nLet me check 6.0828 squared:\n\n6.0828 * 6.0828. Let's compute:\n\n6 * 6 = 36\n\n6 * 0.0828 = 0.4968\n\n0.0828 * 6 = 0.4968\n\n0.0828 * 0.0828 ≈ 0.006855\n\nAdding them up: 36 + 0.4968 + 0.4968 + 0.006855 ≈ 36 + 0.9936 + 0.006855 ≈ 37.000455.\n\nWow, that's extremely close to 37. So, sqrt(37) ≈ 6.0828.\n\nTherefore, my initial estimate was almost spot on. So, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.0828.\n\nSimilarly, for sqrt(6), let me check my approximation again. I had 2.45 squared as 6.0025, which is just 0.0025 over 6. So, to get a slightly better approximation, let's use linear approximation.\n\nDerivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2*sqrt(x)). At x = 6.0025, the derivative is 1/(2*2.45) ≈ 1/4.9 ≈ 0.2041.\n\nSo, to increase sqrt(x) by 0.0025, we need to increase x by approximately 0.2041 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.00051.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(6) ≈ 2.45 + 0.00051 ≈ 2.45051.\n\nLet me check 2.45051 squared:\n\n2.45051 * 2.45051. Let's compute:\n\n2 * 2 = 4\n\n2 * 0.05051 = 0.10102\n\n0.05051 * 2 = 0.10102\n\n0.05051 * 0.05051 ≈ 0.002551\n\nAdding them up: 4 + 0.10102 + 0.10102 + 0.002551 ≈ 4 + 0.20204 + 0.002551 ≈ 4.204591.\n\nWait, that's way less than 6. Hmm, that can't be right. I must have messed up the approximation.\n\nWait, no, because my initial approximation was 2.45, but 2.45 squared is 6.0025, which is indeed only 0.0025 over 6. So, to get a better approximation, let's consider that 2.45 squared is 6.0025, so to get to 6, we need to subtract 0.0025.\n\nUsing linear approximation, the derivative at x = 6.0025 is 1/(2*sqrt(6.0025)) ≈ 1/(2*2.4505) ≈ 1/4.901 ≈ 0.2041.\n\nTherefore, to decrease x by 0.0025, we need to decrease x by approximately 0.2041 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.00051.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(6) ≈ 2.45 - 0.00051 ≈ 2.44949.\n\nLet me check 2.44949 squared:\n\n2.44949 * 2.44949.\n\nCompute 2.449 * 2.449:\n\n2 * 2 = 4\n\n2 * 0.449 ="

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(3) + sqrt(24) is larger than sqrt(20) + sqrt(23) or vice versa. Hmm, let me write down both expressions first:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(3) + sqrt(24)\nExpression B: sqrt(20) + sqrt(23)\n\nI guess the way to compare them is to calculate each one numerically and then see which is bigger. But before I jump into that, maybe I can simplify sqrt(24) and sqrt(20) to see if that helps.\n\nLet me simplify sqrt(24). I know that 24 is 4 times 6, and sqrt(4) is 2, so sqrt(24) is 2*sqrt(6). Similarly, sqrt(20) can be simplified because 20 is 4 times 5, so sqrt(20) is 2*sqrt(5). So rewriting the expressions:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(3) + 2*sqrt(6)\nExpression B: 2*sqrt(5) + sqrt(23)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps much, but maybe I can compute the approximate decimal values of each term to compare.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nsqrt(3) is approximately 1.732\nsqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so 2*sqrt(6) is about 4.898\nsqrt(20) is approximately 4.472\nsqrt(23) is approximately 4.796\n\nSo plugging these back into the expressions:\n\nExpression A: 1.732 + 4.898 ≈ 6.630\nExpression B: 4.472 + 4.796 ≈ 9.268\n\nWait, that seems pretty big. So according to these approximations, Expression B is larger than Expression A? But that seems counterintuitive because sqrt(20) is closer to 4.472 and sqrt(23) is 4.796, so together they should be around 9.268, which is definitely bigger than 6.630.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in my approximations. Let me double-check.\n\nCalculating sqrt(3): 1.732 is correct.\n\nsqrt(6): 2.449 is correct, so 2*sqrt(6) is 4.898. That seems right.\n\nsqrt(20): 4.472 is correct because sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(20) is a bit less, about 4.472.\n\nsqrt(23): 4.796. Let's check that. 4.8 squared is 23.04, so sqrt(23) is a bit less than 4.8, approximately 4.796. That seems accurate.\n\nSo Expression A is 1.732 + 4.898. Let me add them: 1.732 + 4.898. 1 + 4 is 5, 0.732 + 0.898 is 1.630, so total is 6.630. Expression B is 4.472 + 4.796. 4 + 4 is 8, 0.472 + 0.796 is 1.268, so total is 9.268.\n\nSo yes, 9.268 is definitely larger than 6.630, so Expression B is larger. But wait, the question is to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So Expression B is sqrt(20) + sqrt(23). Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(20) + sqrt(23).\n\nBut hold on, before I conclude, maybe I can do a more precise calculation without approximating so much. Maybe using more decimal places to be sure.\n\nLet me calculate sqrt(3) more precisely. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205080757.\n\nsqrt(6): 2.449489743. So 2*sqrt(6) is 4.898979486.\n\nAdding them together: 1.73205080757 + 4.898979486 ≈ 6.6310302935.\n\nNow, sqrt(20): let's compute it more accurately. 4.472135955.\n\nsqrt(23): 4.795831523.\n\nAdding them together: 4.472135955 + 4.795831523 ≈ 9.267967478.\n\nSo, Expression B is approximately 9.267967478, which is indeed larger than Expression A's 6.6310302935.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(20) + sqrt(23). So I should write that in the box.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can check the difference between the two expressions. Let's compute Expression B minus Expression A:\n\n(2*sqrt(5) + sqrt(23)) - (sqrt(3) + 2*sqrt(6)).\n\nWe have sqrt(5) approximately 2.2360679775, so 2*sqrt(5) is 4.472135955.\n\nsqrt(23) is 4.795831523.\n\nAdding those together: 4.472135955 + 4.795831523 ≈ 9.267967478.\n\nExpression A: sqrt(3) + 2*sqrt(6). sqrt(3) is 1.73205080757, 2*sqrt(6) is 4.898979486, so total is 6.6310302935.\n\nSubtracting: 9.267967478 - 6.6310302935 ≈ 2.6369371845.\n\nWhich is positive, so Expression B is indeed larger.\n\nHmm, but just to see if there's another way to compare without approximating, maybe by squaring both expressions. But squaring can sometimes lead to errors because of the cross terms, but let's try.\n\nLet’s denote Expression A as S_A = sqrt(3) + sqrt(24)\n\nExpression B as S_B = sqrt(20) + sqrt(23)\n\nWe can compute S_A^2 and S_B^2 and compare them.\n\nCompute S_A^2: (sqrt(3) + sqrt(24))^2 = 3 + 2*sqrt(3*24) + 24 = 27 + 2*sqrt(72).\n\nSimplify sqrt(72): sqrt(36*2) = 6*sqrt(2). So S_A^2 = 27 + 12*sqrt(2).\n\nCompute S_B^2: (sqrt(20) + sqrt(23))^2 = 20 + 2*sqrt(20*23) + 23 = 43 + 2*sqrt(460).\n\nSimplify sqrt(460): sqrt(400 + 60) = sqrt(4*115) = 2*sqrt(115). So S_B^2 = 43 + 4*sqrt(115).\n\nNow, compare S_A^2 and S_B^2: 27 + 12*sqrt(2) vs. 43 + 4*sqrt(115).\n\nCompute 12*sqrt(2): sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so 12*1.4142 ≈ 16.970.\n\nSo S_A^2 ≈ 27 + 16.970 ≈ 43.970.\n\nCompute 4*sqrt(115): sqrt(100) is 10, sqrt(121) is 11, so sqrt(115) is approximately 10.7238. So 4*10.7238 ≈ 42.895.\n\nThus, S_B^2 ≈ 43 + 42.895 ≈ 85.895.\n\nSo now, S_A^2 ≈ 43.970, S_B^2 ≈ 85.895.\n\nSince 85.895 > 43.970, S_B^2 is larger, so S_B is larger than S_A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(20) + sqrt(23) is larger than sqrt(3) + sqrt(24).\n\nSo"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(5) + sqrt(44) is larger than sqrt(28) + sqrt(39) or vice versa. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when comparing the sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help simplify the comparison. But I have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions or change the inequality direction depending on the signs. Since all these square roots are positive, squaring should maintain the inequality.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(44) and B = sqrt(28) + sqrt(39).

Since 15²=225, sqrt(220) is a bit less than 15, maybe around 14.83.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1092). Let's see, 33²=1089, so sqrt(1092) is just a bit more than 33, maybe around 33.04.\n\nSo, sqrt(220) ≈14.83 and sqrt(1092)≈33.04.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(220) - sqrt(1092) ≈14.83 -33.04≈-18.21.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nA² - B² ≈ (-18) + 2*(-18.21) ≈-18 -36.42≈-54.42.\n\nSo, A² - B²≈-54.42, which is negative.\n\nTherefore, A² < B², so A < B.\n\nWait, hold on, so A is sqrt(5) + sqrt(44), and B is sqrt(28) + sqrt(39). So, A² is 49 + 2*sqrt(220), and B² is 67 + 2*sqrt(1092). Since A² is less than B², then A must be less than B.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because approximating sqrt(220) and sqrt(1092) might be a little off.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(220):\n\nsqrt(220) = sqrt(4*55) = 2*sqrt(55). sqrt(55) is about 7.416, so 2*7.416≈14.832. So, that's correct.\n\nsqrt(1092): Let's see, 33²=1089, so 33²=1089, then sqrt(1092)=sqrt(1089+3)=sqrt(33²+3). So, it's approximately 33 + 3/(2*33)≈33 + 0.045≈33.045. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(220) - sqrt(1092)≈14.832 -33.045≈-18.213.\n\nSo, 2*(sqrt(220) - sqrt(1092))≈2*(-18.213)≈-36.426.\n\nTherefore, A² - B²≈-18 -36.426≈-54.426, which is negative.\n\nTherefore, A² < B², so A < B.\n\nHence, sqrt(28) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(44).\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me make sure that the approximations I did aren't causing a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a more exact way to compare A and B without approximating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the difference between A and B and see whether it's positive or negative.\n\nSo, since A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(44), and B = sqrt(28) + sqrt(39).\n\nCompute B - A = (sqrt(28) + sqrt(39)) - (sqrt(5) + sqrt(44)).\n\nI need to see whether this is positive or negative.\n\nCompute B - A = sqrt(28) - sqrt(5) + sqrt(39) - sqrt(44).\n\nLet me compute each pair:\n\nsqrt(28) - sqrt(5) ≈5.2915 -2.2361≈3.0554.\n\nsqrt(39) - sqrt(44)≈6.2449 -6.6332≈-0.3883.\n\nTherefore, adding these two: 3.0554 -0.3883≈2.6671.\n\nSo, B - A≈2.6671, which is positive. Therefore, B > A.\n\nHence, sqrt(28) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(5)+sqrt(44).

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(17) + sqrt(48) and sqrt(29) + sqrt(31). The goal is to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, comparing sums of square roots isn't straightforward because square roots grow in a non-linear way. I remember that sometimes, to compare two expressions, you can square them to eliminate the square roots, but I also recall that squaring can sometimes introduce complexities or errors, especially if the original expressions are negative or something. But in this case, all the numbers inside the square roots are positive, so squaring should be safe.\n\nSo, let me denote the first expression as A = sqrt(17) + sqrt(48) and the second as B = sqrt(29) + sqrt(31). I'll compute A² and B² and then compare A² and B². If A² > B², then A > B, and vice versa. That should work, right?\n\nAlright, let's calculate A² first. A² = (sqrt(17) + sqrt(48))². Using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², this becomes 17 + 2*sqrt(17*48) + 48. Let me compute each part:\n\n17 + 48 is straightforward, that's 65. The middle term is 2*sqrt(17*48). Let me calculate 17*48. 17*40 is 680, and 17*8 is 136, so 680 + 136 = 816. Thus, the middle term is 2*sqrt(816). Hmm, sqrt(816) is a bit tricky. Let me see if I can simplify that.\n\n816 divided by 16 is 51, so sqrt(816) = sqrt(16*51) = 4*sqrt(51). Therefore, 2*sqrt(816) = 2*4*sqrt(51) = 8*sqrt(51). So, putting it all together, A² = 65 + 8*sqrt(51).\n\nNow, moving on to B². B is sqrt(29) + sqrt(31), so squaring that gives (sqrt(29) + sqrt(31))² = 29 + 2*sqrt(29*31) + 31. Let's compute each part too.\n\n29 + 31 is 60. The middle term is 2*sqrt(29*31). Let me compute 29*31. 29*30 is 870, and 29*1 is 29, so 870 + 29 = 899. Therefore, the middle term is 2*sqrt(899). Hmm, sqrt(899) – can I simplify that?\n\n899 is a prime number? Wait, 899 divided by 29 is 31 because 29*31 is 899. Oh, that's interesting. So sqrt(899) is sqrt(29*31) which is already simplified. So, the middle term is 2*sqrt(899). So, B² = 60 + 2*sqrt(899).\n\nAlright, so now we have A² = 65 + 8*sqrt(51) and B² = 60 + 2*sqrt(899). I need to compare these two.\n\nLet me calculate the numerical values of each to see which is larger. I can approximate sqrt(51) and sqrt(899).\n\nFirst, sqrt(51). Well, 7² is 49, so sqrt(51) is a little more than 7, maybe 7.14? Let me check: 7.1² is 50.41, 7.14² is 50.9796, which is pretty close to 51. So, sqrt(51) ≈ 7.14.\n\nTherefore, 8*sqrt(51) ≈ 8*7.14 ≈ 57.12.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 65 + 57.12 ≈ 122.12.\n\nNow, sqrt(899). Hmm, 29² is 841, 30² is 900, so sqrt(899) is just a little less than 30. Specifically, 30² is 900, so 899 is 1 less, so sqrt(899) ≈ 29.9833.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(899) ≈ 2*29.9833 ≈ 59.9666.\n\nSo, B² ≈ 60 + 59.9666 ≈ 119.9666.\n\nComparing A² ≈ 122.12 and B² ≈ 119.9666, A² is clearly greater than B². Therefore, A > B.\n\nSo, the larger number is sqrt(17) + sqrt(48). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(17) + sqrt(48), which can be written as \\boxed{\\sqrt{17} + \\sqrt{48}}.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify my calculations.\n\nFirst, A² = (sqrt(17) + sqrt(48))² = 17 + 48 + 2*sqrt(17*48) = 65 + 2*sqrt(816). Wait, I had earlier simplified sqrt(816) to 4*sqrt(51), so that's 8*sqrt(51). So, yeah, A² is 65 + 8*sqrt(51). That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, B² = (sqrt(29) + sqrt(31))² = 29 + 31 + 2*sqrt(29*31) = 60 + 2*sqrt(899). Correct.\n\nSo, I think my approximations were okay. Let me double-check sqrt(51) and sqrt(899).\n\nCalculating sqrt(51):\n\n7.14² = (7 + 0.14)² = 7² + 2*7*0.14 + 0.14² = 49 + 1.96 + 0.0196 = 50.9796, which is about 51. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 8*sqrt(51) ≈ 57.12, so A² ≈ 65 + 57.12 = 122.12.\n\nsqrt(899):\n\nAs I thought, 29² = 841, 30² = 900, so sqrt(899) is just a hair less than 30. Let me compute 29.99²:\n\n29.99² = (30 - 0.01)² = 30² - 2*30*0.01 + 0.01² = 900 - 0.6 + 0.0001 = 899.4001.\n\nBut 899 is 0.5999 less than 900, so sqrt(899) is approximately 29.99 - (0.5999)/(2*29.99) ≈ 29.99 - 0.0103 ≈ 29.9797.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(899) ≈ 2*29.9797 ≈ 59.9594. So, B² ≈ 60 + 59.9594 ≈ 119.9594.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 122.12 and B² ≈ 119.9594, so A² is indeed greater. So, the conclusion remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to consider the difference A² - B² and see if it's positive. Let's compute A² - B².\n\nA² - B² = (65 + 8*sqrt(51)) - (60 + 2*sqrt(899)) = 5 + 8*sqrt(51) - 2*sqrt(899).\n\nLet me write this as 5 + 8*sqrt(51) - 2*sqrt(899). We need to see if this is positive.\n\nBut 5 is a small number, so I need to see whether 8*sqrt(5"

I need to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes it's useful to square both expressions to make them easier to compare. That might help because squaring can turn the sum into a comparison of individual terms, which might be simpler. But I also need to consider that squaring can sometimes introduce extra solutions or complicate things, but in this case, since we're just comparing two sums, squaring should be fine.\n\nSo, let me denote A = sqrt(29) + sqrt(47) and B = sqrt(33) + sqrt(40). I want to compare A and B. If I square both A and B, I can get A² and B², which are easier to handle. Let me write that down:\n\nA² = (sqrt(29) + sqrt(47))²\nB² = (sqrt(33) + sqrt(40))²\n\nI know that (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y², so applying that here:\n\nA² = 29 + 2*sqrt(29*47) + 47\nB² = 33 + 2*sqrt(33*40) + 40\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, A²:\n\n29 + 47 is 76, so A² = 76 + 2*sqrt(29*47). Let me calculate 29*47. 29*40 is 1160, and 29*7 is 203, so 1160 + 203 is 1363. So, A² = 76 + 2*sqrt(1363).\n\nSimilarly, B²:\n\n33 + 40 is 73, so B² = 73 + 2*sqrt(33*40). 33*40 is 1320, so B² = 73 + 2*sqrt(1320).\n\nNow, so I have A² = 76 + 2*sqrt(1363) and B² = 73 + 2*sqrt(1320). I need to compare these two. Since sqrt(1363) is a bit more than sqrt(1320), but let me see if the difference is more in the linear term or in the square root term.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I can subtract them to see the difference:\n\nA² - B² = (76 - 73) + 2*(sqrt(1363) - sqrt(1320)) = 3 + 2*(sqrt(1363) - sqrt(1320)).\n\nSo, if A² - B² is positive, then A² > B², so A > B. If it's negative, then A < B. So, let me compute sqrt(1363) - sqrt(1320). Let me estimate these square roots.\n\nFirst, sqrt(1369) is 37, since 37² = 1369. So sqrt(1363) is 37 - something. Similarly, sqrt(1320) is sqrt(1369 - 49) which is roughly 37 minus some small amount.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(1363):\n\n37² = 1369, so 1369 - 1363 = 6. So, sqrt(1363) = 37 - (6)/(2*37) approximately, using the linear approximation for sqrt(x² - a). So, that's 37 - 3/37 ≈ 37 - 0.0811 ≈ 36.9189.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1320):\n\nAgain, 37² = 1369, so 1320 is 1369 - 49. So, sqrt(1320) = 37 - (49)/(2*37) ≈ 37 - 49/74 ≈ 37 - 0.6622 ≈ 36.3378.\n\nSo sqrt(1363) ≈ 36.9189 and sqrt(1320) ≈ 36.3378. The difference is approximately 36.9189 - 36.3378 ≈ 0.5811.\n\nSo, sqrt(1363) - sqrt(1320) ≈ 0.5811.\n\nTherefore, A² - B² ≈ 3 + 2*(0.5811) ≈ 3 + 1.1622 ≈ 4.1622.\n\nSince this is positive, A² > B². Therefore, A > B. So, sqrt(29) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(33) + sqrt(40).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, because sometimes when you approximate, the actual difference might be slightly different. Maybe I should compute sqrt(1363) and sqrt(1320) more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the exact difference using more precise methods.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute sqrt(1363) and sqrt(1320) using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I can approximate.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute sqrt(1363):\n\n37² = 1369, as before. So sqrt(1363) is 37 - (1369 - 1363)/(2*37) = 37 - 6/74 ≈ 37 - 0.08105 ≈ 36.91895.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1320):\n\nsqrt(1320): 36² = 1296, so 37² = 1369. So, 1320 is 1369 - 49, so sqrt(1320) = 37 - 49/(2*37) = 37 - 49/74 ≈ 37 - 0.66216 ≈ 36.33784.\n\nSo, sqrt(1363) ≈ 36.91895 and sqrt(1320) ≈ 36.33784, so the difference is approximately 36.91895 - 36.33784 ≈ 0.58111.\n\nTherefore, A² - B² ≈ 3 + 2*(0.58111) ≈ 3 + 1.16222 ≈ 4.16222, which is positive. Therefore, A² > B², so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(29) + sqrt(47) is larger than sqrt(33) + sqrt(40). So, the larger number is sqrt(29) + sqrt(47). So, I can write that as the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute sqrt(29), sqrt(47), sqrt(33), sqrt(40), and add them numerically to get a sense.\n\nCompute sqrt(29):\n\nsqrt(25) = 5, sqrt(36) = 6, so sqrt(29) is approximately 5.385.\n\nsqrt(47):\n\nsqrt(36) = 6, sqrt(49) = 7, so sqrt(47) is about 6.855.\n\nSo, sqrt(29) + sqrt(47) ≈ 5.385 + 6.855 ≈ 12.24.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(33):\n\nsqrt(25) = 5, sqrt(36) = 6, so sqrt(33) is about 5.744.\n\nsqrt(40):\n\nsqrt(36) = 6, sqrt(49) = 7, so sqrt(40) is about 6.325.\n\nSo, sqrt(33) + sqrt(40) ≈ 5.744 + 6.325 ≈ 12.069.\n\nSo, 12.24 versus 12.069. So, sqrt(29) + sqrt(47) is indeed larger.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, maybe I can compute sqrt(29) + sqrt(47) more precisely.\n\nCompute sqrt(29):\n\nLet me use the Newton-Raphson method.\n\nLet f(x) = x² - 29,"

Let me write that down.\n\nLet A = sqrt(3) + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(15) + sqrt(43). I need to find out whether A > B or B > A. To do that, I can square both A and B and then compare the results.\n\nSo, squaring A: (sqrt(3) + sqrt(50))^2. Using the formula (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2, this becomes (sqrt(3))^2 + 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(50) + (sqrt(50))^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n- (sqrt(3))^2 = 3\n- 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(50) = 2*sqrt(150)\n- (sqrt(50))^2 = 50\n\nAdding them up: 3 + 50 + 2*sqrt(150) = 53 + 2*sqrt(150). So, A^2 = 53 + 2*sqrt(150).\n\nNow, squaring B: (sqrt(15) + sqrt(43))^2. Again, applying the same formula:\n- (sqrt(15))^2 = 15\n- 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(43) = 2*sqrt(645)\n- (sqrt(43))^2 = 43\n\nAdding them up: 15 + 43 + 2*sqrt(645) = 58 + 2*sqrt(645). So, B^2 = 58 + 2*sqrt(645).\n\nNow, I need to compare A^2 and B^2. If A^2 > B^2, then A > B, and vice versa. Let me see:\n\nA^2 = 53 + 2*sqrt(150)\nB^2 = 58 + 2*sqrt(645)\n\nSo, subtracting A^2 from B^2: (58 + 2*sqrt(645)) - (53 + 2*sqrt(150)) = 5 + 2*(sqrt(645) - sqrt(150)).\n\nHmm, that's 5 plus twice something. I need to figure out whether sqrt(645) is significantly larger than sqrt(150). Let me approximate these square roots.\n\nFirst, sqrt(150). Well, sqrt(144) is 12, sqrt(169) is 13, so sqrt(150) is between 12 and 13. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\n150 is 25*6, so sqrt(25*6) = 5*sqrt(6). sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so 5*2.449 ≈ 12.245. So, sqrt(150) ≈ 12.245.\n\nNext, sqrt(645). 645 is 25*25.8, but that's not helpful. Let me see, 25^2 is 625, and 26^2 is 676. So sqrt(645) is between 25 and 26. Let's compute it.\n\n25.5^2 = (25 + 0.5)^2 = 25^2 + 2*25*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 625 + 25 + 0.25 = 650.25. That's higher than 645, so sqrt(645) is less than 25.5.\n\nLet me try 25.4^2 = (25 + 0.4)^2 = 25^2 + 2*25*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 625 + 20 + 0.16 = 645.16. Hmm, that's pretty close to 645. So, sqrt(645) is approximately 25.4, but a tiny bit less.\n\nBecause 25.4^2 = 645.16, so sqrt(645) ≈ 25.4 - 0.016/(2*25.4) ≈ 25.4 - 0.000318 ≈ 25.399682. So, approximately 25.3997.\n\nSo, sqrt(645) ≈ 25.3997 and sqrt(150) ≈ 12.245.\n\nNow, let's plug these back into the difference A^2 - B^2:\n\n5 + 2*(25.3997 - 12.245) = 5 + 2*(13.1547) = 5 + 26.3094 = 31.3094.\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 ≈ 31.3094, which is positive. Therefore, A^2 > B^2, so A > B. So, sqrt(3) + sqrt(50) is larger than sqrt(15) + sqrt(43).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can lead to errors. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, instead of computing the exact numerical values, maybe I can see which expression is bigger by comparing the terms.\n\nLooking at A = sqrt(3) + sqrt(50). Let me note that sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2) = 5*sqrt(2) ≈ 5*1.4142 ≈ 7.071.\n\nSimilarly, A = sqrt(3) + 7.071 ≈ 1.732 + 7.071 ≈ 8.803.\n\nNow, B = sqrt(15) + sqrt(43). Let's compute sqrt(15): sqrt(9*1.666) ≈ 3.872. Wait, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 3^2=9, 4^2=16, so sqrt(15) is between 3 and 4. 3.872^2 is approximately 15.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(43): 6^2=36, 7^2=49, so sqrt(43) is approximately 6.557.\n\nSo, B ≈ 3.872 + 6.557 ≈ 10.429.\n\nWait, that's different from my first calculation. Wait, hold on, why did I get A ≈ 8.803 and B ≈ 10.429?\n\nWait, hold on, that conflicts with my first calculation where I thought A was sqrt(3) + sqrt(50) ≈ 1.732 + 7.071 ≈ 8.803 and B was sqrt(15) + sqrt(43) ≈ 3.872 + 6.557 ≈ 10.429, so in that case, B is larger. But when I squared A, I got A^2 ≈ 53 + 2*sqrt(150) ≈ 53 + 2*12.247 ≈ 53 + 24.494 ≈ 77.494.\n\nAnd B^2 was 58 + 2*sqrt(645) ≈ 58 + 2*25.3997 ≈ 58 + 50.799 ≈ 108.799.\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 77.494 and B^2 ≈ 108.799, so B^2 is bigger, so B is bigger. So, which one is it? Wait, in the first approach, I thought A was about 8.8 and B was about 10.4, which would mean B is bigger. In the second approach, computing the actual square roots, I get A ≈ 8.803 and B ≈ 10.429, so B is bigger. So, okay, that matches.\n\nBut wait, when I squared A,"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(13) + sqrt(46) and sqrt(37) + sqrt(41). Hmm, okay. I think the way to approach this is by squaring both expressions since square roots can get messy, and squaring might make the comparison easier. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me denote A as sqrt(13) + sqrt(46) and B as sqrt(37) + sqrt(41). I need to determine which one is larger, A or B. To compare them, I can compute A squared and B squared, which might simplify things because the square of a sum is easier to handle.\n\nSo, let's compute A squared first. That would be:\n\nA² = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(46))²\n\nExpanding this, I remember that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². Applying that here:\n\nA² = (sqrt(13))² + 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(46) + (sqrt(46))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(13))² = 13\n(sqrt(46))² = 46\nThe middle term is 2*sqrt(13*46). Let me compute that:\n\n13*46 is, um, 13*40 is 520, plus 13*6 is 78, so 520 + 78 = 598. Therefore, the middle term is 2*sqrt(598).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nA² = 13 + 2*sqrt(598) + 46\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n13 + 46 = 59\n\nSo, A² = 59 + 2*sqrt(598)\n\nAlright, that's A squared. Now let me compute B squared.\n\nB = sqrt(37) + sqrt(41), so:\n\nB² = (sqrt(37) + sqrt(41))²\n\nAgain, using the expansion (a + b)²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(37))² + 2*sqrt(37)*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(37))² = 37\n(sqrt(41))² = 41\nThe middle term is 2*sqrt(37*41). Let me compute 37*41. Hmm, 37*40 is 1480, plus 37*1 is 37, so 1480 + 37 = 1517. Therefore, the middle term is 2*sqrt(1517).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nB² = 37 + 2*sqrt(1517) + 41\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n37 + 41 = 78\n\nSo, B² = 78 + 2*sqrt(1517)\n\nAlright, so now I have both A² and B²:\n\nA² = 59 + 2*sqrt(598)\nB² = 78 + 2*sqrt(1517)\n\nTo compare A and B, I can compare A² and B². If A² > B², then A > B, and vice versa. So, let's compute the difference between B² and A².\n\nDifference = B² - A² = (78 + 2*sqrt(1517)) - (59 + 2*sqrt(598)) = (78 - 59) + 2*(sqrt(1517) - sqrt(598)) = 19 + 2*(sqrt(1517) - sqrt(598))\n\nSo, the difference is 19 plus twice the difference of the square roots. Since sqrt(1517) is definitely larger than sqrt(598), the difference sqrt(1517) - sqrt(598) is positive, and multiplied by 2, it's still positive. So, adding 19 to that, the total difference is positive. Therefore, B² > A², which means B > A.\n\nWait, hold on, let me verify that. Because sometimes when you square roots, even if one is larger, the increase might not be linear, but in this case, since both expressions have square roots, their squares are being compared.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute approximate values to see.\n\nFirst, compute A²:\n\nA² = 59 + 2*sqrt(598). Let's compute sqrt(598). 24² is 576, 25² is 625, so sqrt(598) is between 24 and 25. Let me compute 24.5²: 24.5*24.5 = (24 + 0.5)^2 = 24² + 2*24*0.5 + 0.5² = 576 + 24 + 0.25 = 576 + 24 is 600, plus 0.25 is 600.25. So sqrt(598) is less than 24.5, since 24.5² is 600.25, which is higher than 598. So, sqrt(598) ≈ 24.45?\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1517) is larger. Let's see, 38² is 1444, 39² is 1521. So sqrt(1517) is just a bit less than 39, because 39² is 1521, so 1517 is 4 less, so sqrt(1517) ≈ 39 - 4/(2*39) = 39 - 2/39 ≈ 38.974.\n\nSo, let me compute approximate A² and B².\n\nA² = 59 + 2*sqrt(598). Let's compute sqrt(598). Let's say sqrt(598) ≈ 24.45 (as above). So, 2*24.45 ≈ 48.9.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 59 + 48.9 ≈ 107.9.\n\nSimilarly, B² = 78 + 2*sqrt(1517). Let's compute sqrt(1517) ≈ 38.974, so 2*38.974 ≈ 77.948.\n\nSo, B² ≈ 78 + 77.948 ≈ 155.948.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 107.9, and B² ≈ 155.948. So, B² is larger than A², so B is larger than A.\n\nWait, so that matches my earlier conclusion that B > A.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I should compute the actual values more precisely.\n\nCompute A²:\n\nsqrt(598) ≈ 24.447, so 2*sqrt(598) ≈ 48.894.\n\nA² = 59 + 48.894 ≈ 107.894.\n\nCompute B²:\n\nsqrt(1517) ≈ 38.96, so 2*sqrt(1517) ≈ 77.92.\n\nB² = 78 + 77.92 ≈ 155.92.\n\nSo, 107.894 vs. 155.92. Therefore, B² is significantly larger, so B > A.\n\nSo, that means sqrt(37) + sqrt(41) is greater than sqrt(13) + sqrt(46). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(37) + sqrt(41), which is B.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure. Because sometimes when you square, you might introduce extraneous solutions or miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compare (sqrt(37) + sqrt(41))² and (sqrt(13) + sqrt(46))².\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use another method, like the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality.\n\nWait, but in this case, directly squaring seems straightforward, and the difference was positive, so I think my conclusion is correct.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I can compare the two sums directly without squaring, but I don't see an immediate way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate the decimal values to verify.\n\nCompute sqrt(13): approx 3.6055\n\nsqrt(46): approx 6.7823\n\nSo, A ≈ 3.6055 + 6.7823 ≈ 10.3878\n\nCompute sqrt(37): approx 6.08"

So, sqrt(115) ≈ 10.7236.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(153): 12² is 144, 13² is 169, so sqrt(153) is between 12 and 13. 12.3² is 151.29, 12.4² is 153.76.

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(18) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(42) + sqrt(49). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(18) is the same as sqrt(9*2), which simplifies to 3*sqrt(2). Similarly, sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2), which is 5*sqrt(2). So, if I add them together, sqrt(18) + sqrt(50) becomes 3*sqrt(2) + 5*sqrt(2). That simplifies nicely to (3+5)*sqrt(2) = 8*sqrt(2). Okay, so that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, what about sqrt(42) + sqrt(49)? Well, sqrt(49) is easy because it's a perfect square; it's 7. So, sqrt(42) + sqrt(49) is sqrt(42) + 7.

Also, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(5) is about 2.236, sqrt(6) is roughly 2.449, sqrt(7) is about 2.645, sqrt(8) is approximately 2.828, sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(10) is about 3.162.

Let me check that more accurately. 6.48 squared is approximately 42? Let me see: 6.48 * 6.48. Hmm, 6*6 is 36, 6*0.48 is 2.88, 0.48*6 is another 2.88, and 0.48*0.48 is about 0.2304. So, adding those up: 36 + 2.88 + 2.88 + 0.2304 = 42. So, yes, sqrt(42) is approximately 6.48.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(2) is 1.414, so 8*sqrt(2) is 8*1.414, which is 11.312.\n\nSo, sqrt(42) + 7 is approximately 6.48 + 7 = 13.48.\n\nComparing 11.312 and 13.48, it seems that 13.48 is larger. So, sqrt(42) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(18) + sqrt(50). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(42) + sqrt(49), which is already in the desired form. So, the answer should be sqrt(42) + sqrt(49).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can be misleading. Let me calculate sqrt(42) more accurately.\n\nI can use the method of continued fractions or use a calculator, but since I don't have a calculator here, I can use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate sqrt(42). Let's try that.\n\nStarting with an initial guess of 6.48, as I did earlier. Then, the next approximation is given by (6.48 + 42/6.48)/2. Calculating 42 divided by 6.48: 42 / 6.48 is approximately 6.48. Wait, that can't be, because 6.48 squared is 42, so 42 / 6.48 is 6.48. Hmm, that would make the next approximation (6.48 + 6.48)/2 = 6.48. So, that's not helpful. Hmm, maybe my initial guess was too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have chosen a better initial guess. Let me try 6.48 again, but perhaps a better initial guess. Since 6.48 squared is 42, maybe I should have used 6.5 as the initial guess. Then, 6.5 squared is 42.25, which is a bit higher than 42. So, the next approximation is (6.5 + 42/6.5)/2. Calculating 42 / 6.5: 42 divided by 6.5 is 6.4615. So, adding 6.5 and 6.4615 gives approximately 12.9615. Divided by 2, that's 6.48075. So, another approximation of sqrt(42) is 6.48075.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(42) is approximately 6.48075. So, sqrt(42) + 7 is approximately 6.48075 + 7 = 13.48075.\n\nOn the other hand, sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2) ≈ 3*1.4142 ≈ 4.2426. sqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2) ≈ 5*1.4142 ≈ 7.071. Adding those together: 4.2426 + 7.071 ≈ 11.3136.\n\nComparing 11.3136 and 13.48075, it's clear that sqrt(42) + sqrt(49) is significantly larger than sqrt(18) + sqrt(50). Therefore, sqrt(42) + sqrt(49) is the larger number.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in simplifying sqrt(18) + sqrt(50). So, sqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2) = 3*sqrt(2), that's correct. sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2) = 5*sqrt(2), correct. Adding them together: 3*sqrt(2) + 5*sqrt(2) is indeed 8*sqrt(2). So, that part is correct.\n\nAnd sqrt(42) + sqrt(49) is sqrt(42) + 7. So, yeah, approximating is the way to go here because exact square roots are irrational and can't be expressed as exact decimals.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compare is to square both expressions and see which one is larger. Let me try that method as a verification.\n\nLet A = sqrt(18) + sqrt(50)\nLet B = sqrt(42) + sqrt(49)\n\nCompute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(18) + sqrt(50))^2 = 18 + 2*sqrt(18*50) + 50 = 68 + 2*sqrt(900) = 68 + 2*30 = 68 + 60 = 128.\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(42) + sqrt(49))^2 = 42 + 2*sqrt(42*49) + 49 = 91 + 2*sqrt(2058).\n\nWait, sqrt(2058) is sqrt(2058). Let me compute that. 2058 is 49*42, so sqrt(2058) = sqrt(49*42) = 7*sqrt(42). So, sqrt(2058) is 7*sqrt(42). So, 2*sqrt(2058) is 14*sqrt(42).\n\nTherefore, B^2 = 91 + 14*sqrt(42). Hmm, okay. So, now, let's compute this numerically.\n\nFirst, A^2 is 128, so A is sqrt(128) ≈ 11.3137.\n\nB^2 is 91 + 14*sqrt(42). Let's compute sqrt(42) again, which is approximately 6.48075. So, 14*sqrt(42) ≈ 14*6."

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(5) + sqrt(45) and sqrt(10) + sqrt(35). And then I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I can simplify some of these square roots to see if that helps. Let me look at sqrt(45) and sqrt(35). I know that 45 is 9 times 5, right? So sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5), which is sqrt(9)*sqrt(5). And sqrt(9) is 3, so that simplifies to 3*sqrt(5). Similarly, sqrt(35) is sqrt(5*7), which doesn't simplify further because 5 and 7 are both primes. So sqrt(35) stays as sqrt(35).\n\nSo then, sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5). So sqrt(5) + sqrt(45) is sqrt(5) + 3*sqrt(5). That seems like I can combine those terms because they're both multiples of sqrt(5). So sqrt(5) is like 1*sqrt(5), so adding 1*sqrt(5) and 3*sqrt(5) gives me 4*sqrt(5). Okay, so sqrt(5) + sqrt(45) simplifies to 4*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, what about sqrt(10) + sqrt(35)? Let me see if I can simplify sqrt(35). 35 is 5*7, which doesn't have any square factors, so that's as simplified as it gets. What about sqrt(10)? 10 is 2*5, which also doesn't have any square factors, so that stays as sqrt(10).\n\nSo sqrt(10) + sqrt(35) doesn't seem to simplify in the same way as sqrt(5) + sqrt(45). Hmm, so maybe I need a different approach. Maybe I can square both expressions to compare them? Because sometimes squaring can make things easier to compare.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(45). As we saw, A simplifies to 4*sqrt(5). Then B = sqrt(10) + sqrt(35). Let me square both A and B.\n\nFirst, A squared is (sqrt(5) + sqrt(45))². Let's compute that. It should be (sqrt(5))² + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(45) + (sqrt(45))². Let's compute each term:\n\n(sqrt(5))² is 5.\n\n2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(45) is 2*sqrt(5*45). Let me compute 5*45 first, which is 225. So sqrt(225) is 15. So that middle term is 2*15 = 30.\n\nAnd (sqrt(45))² is 45.\n\nSo adding them up: 5 + 30 + 45 = 80. So A squared is 80. Therefore, A is sqrt(80). Wait, but A is 4*sqrt(5), so let me check: 4*sqrt(5) squared is 16*(sqrt(5))² = 16*5 = 80. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nNow, let's compute B squared, which is (sqrt(10) + sqrt(35))². That's (sqrt(10))² + 2*sqrt(10)*sqrt(35) + (sqrt(35))².\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(sqrt(10))² is 10.\n\n2*sqrt(10)*sqrt(35) is 2*sqrt(10*35). 10*35 is 350. So sqrt(350). Hmm, can I simplify sqrt(350)? Let's see, 350 is 25*14, right? Because 25*14 is 350. So sqrt(350) is sqrt(25*14) which is 5*sqrt(14). So the middle term is 2*5*sqrt(14) = 10*sqrt(14).\n\nAnd (sqrt(35))² is 35.\n\nSo adding them up: 10 + 10*sqrt(14) + 35 = 45 + 10*sqrt(14). So B squared is 45 + 10*sqrt(14).\n\nSo now, to compare A squared and B squared. A squared is 80, and B squared is 45 + 10*sqrt(14). I need to figure out which one is larger.\n\nLet me compute B squared numerically to see. First, sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417. So 10*sqrt(14) is approximately 10*3.7417 = 37.417. So adding 45 to that, 45 + 37.417 is 82.417.\n\nSo B squared is approximately 82.417, and A squared is exactly 80. So 82.417 is larger than 80. Therefore, B squared is larger than A squared, which means B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(10) + sqrt(35) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(45). So the larger number is sqrt(10) + sqrt(35), which is in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) with a=10 and b=35.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me double-check A squared:\n\nA = sqrt(5) + sqrt(45). sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5), so A is sqrt(5) + 3*sqrt(5) = 4*sqrt(5). Then A squared is (4*sqrt(5))² = 16*5 = 80. That's correct.\n\nFor B squared, sqrt(10) + sqrt(35). Let's see, 10 is 2*5 and 35 is 5*7, so they don't have square factors. So we can't simplify those radicals. So when we square B, we have:\n\n(sqrt(10))² = 10, (sqrt(35))² = 35, and the cross term is 2*sqrt(10)*sqrt(35) = 2*sqrt(350). Which is 2*sqrt(25*14) = 2*5*sqrt(14) = 10*sqrt(14). So B squared is 10 + 35 + 10*sqrt(14) = 45 + 10*sqrt(14). That's correct.\n\nThen, to compute 10*sqrt(14): sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417, so 10*3.7417 is 37.417, and then adding 45 gives 82.417, which is indeed larger than 80. So yes, B squared is larger, so B is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't square them, maybe I could compare sqrt(10) + sqrt(35) and 4*sqrt(5). Let me try that approach for cross-verification.\n\nLet me denote C = sqrt(10) + sqrt(35). And D = 4*sqrt(5). I want to see if C > D or not. Let me compute C² and D².\n\nC² is (sqrt(10) + sqrt(35))² = 10 + 35 + 2*sqrt(350) = 45 + 2*sqrt(350). D² is (4*sqrt(5))² = 16*5 = 80.\n\nSo now, comparing C² and D². C² is 45 + 2*sqrt(350), D² is 80.\n\nSo can I compute 2*sqrt(350) and see if it's larger than 80 - 45 = 35.\n\nCompute sqrt(350): as before, 350 is 25*14, so sqrt(25*14) = 5*sqrt(14). So 2*sqrt(350) is 2*5*sqrt(14) = 10*sqrt(14). We saw earlier that sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417, so 10*3.7417 is approximately 37.417.\n\nSo C² is 45 + 37.417 = 82.417, which is indeed greater than 80. So again, C² > D², so C > D. So same result.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(25) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(27) + sqrt(38). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll write down both expressions clearly:\n\n1. sqrt(25) + sqrt(50)\n2. sqrt(27) + sqrt(38)\n\nI need to determine which of these two sums is larger. I know that square roots can be tricky, especially when they are not perfect squares, but maybe I can simplify them or find approximate values to compare.\n\nStarting with the first expression: sqrt(25) + sqrt(50). I know that sqrt(25) is straightforward because 25 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(25) is 5. Now, sqrt(50) is a bit more complicated. I remember that 50 can be factored into 25 * 2, and since 25 is a perfect square, I can take that out of the square root. So, sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2) which is sqrt(25)*sqrt(2) = 5*sqrt(2). Therefore, the first expression simplifies to 5 + 5*sqrt(2). Let me write that down:\n\nFirst expression: 5 + 5√2.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(27) + sqrt(38). Again, both 27 and 38 are not perfect squares, so I'll need to see if I can factor them into terms that have perfect squares inside the radicals.\n\nStarting with sqrt(27): 27 can be factored into 9 * 3, and 9 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(27) is sqrt(9*3) = sqrt(9)*sqrt(3) = 3*sqrt(3).\n\nNext, sqrt(38): 38 factors into 2 * 19, and neither 2 nor 19 is a perfect square, so sqrt(38) cannot be simplified further. Therefore, the second expression simplifies to 3√3 + √38.\n\nSo now, both expressions are simplified:\n\n1. 5 + 5√2\n2. 3√3 + √38\n\nI need to compare these two expressions. Since they are both sums of square roots, perhaps I can approximate the values of each square root to see which sum is larger.\n\nLet me recall the approximate values of these square roots:\n\nFirst, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(5), sqrt(6), sqrt(7), sqrt(11), sqrt(13), sqrt(17), sqrt(19), sqrt(23), sqrt(29), sqrt(30), sqrt(31), sqrt(32), sqrt(33), sqrt(34), sqrt(35), sqrt(37), sqrt(38), sqrt(39), sqrt(40)...\n\nBut since I only need up to sqrt(50), which is 7.07, but maybe I can get more precise.\n\nLet me list some approximate square roots:\n\n- sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142\n- sqrt(3) ≈ 1.7320\n- sqrt(5) ≈ 2.2361\n- sqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495\n- sqrt(7) ≈ 2.6458\n- sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623\n- sqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166\n- sqrt(12) ≈ 3.4641\n- sqrt(13) ≈ 3.6055\n- sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417\n- sqrt(15) ≈ 3.8729\n- sqrt(16) = 4.0\n- sqrt(17) ≈ 4.1231\n- sqrt(18) ≈ 4.2426\n- sqrt(19) ≈ 4.3589\n- sqrt(20) ≈ 4.4721\n- sqrt(21) ≈ 4.5837\n- sqrt(22) ≈ 4.6904\n- sqrt(23) ≈ 4.7958\n- sqrt(24) ≈ 4.8990\n- sqrt(25) = 5.0\n- sqrt(26) ≈ 5.0990\n- sqrt(27) ≈ 5.1962\n- sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915\n- sqrt(29) ≈ 5.3852\n- sqrt(30) ≈ 5.4772\n- sqrt(31) ≈ 5.5678\n- sqrt(32) ≈ 5.6568\n- sqrt(33) ≈ 5.7446\n- sqrt(34) ≈ 5.8309\n- sqrt(35) ≈ 5.9161\n- sqrt(36) = 6.0\n- sqrt(37) ≈ 6.0828\n- sqrt(38) ≈ 6.1644\n- sqrt(39) ≈ 6.2450\n- sqrt(40) ≈ 6.3246\n\nWait, I don't need sqrt(40) here, but let me make sure I have enough to compare sqrt(38) and sqrt(37). So, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.0828 and sqrt(38) is approximately 6.1644.\n\nGoing back to the first expression: 5 + 5√2. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst expression: 5 + 5√2 ≈ 5 + 5*1.4142 ≈ 5 + 7.071 ≈ 12.071\n\nSecond expression: 3√3 + √38 ≈ 3*1.7320 + 6.1644 ≈ 5.196 + 6.1644 ≈ 11.3604\n\nSo, approximately, the first expression is about 12.071, while the second is about 11.3604. Therefore, sqrt(25) + sqrt(50) is larger.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check these approximations because sometimes approximations can be misleading, especially when dealing with square roots.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(2) more accurately. I know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.41421356, so 5*sqrt(2) is 5*1.41421356 ≈ 7.0710678. Then 5 + 7.0710678 ≈ 12.0710678, which is about 12.071.\n\nNow, for the second expression: 3√3 is 3*1.7320508075688772 ≈ 5.196152422706632. Then, adding sqrt(38) which is approximately 6.164414023181288, so 5.196152422706632 + 6.164414023181288 ≈ 11.36056644588792.\n\nSo, 12.0710678 vs. 11.36056644588792.\n\nComparing these, 12.071 is clearly larger than 11.3605. Therefore, the first expression is larger.\n\nBut wait, hold on a moment. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I do these approximations, I might miss a decimal point or something.\n\nLooking back, I think my approximations are correct because sqrt(2) is roughly 1.4142, so 5*1.4142 is 7.071, which added to 5 gives 12.071. For the second expression, 3√3 is about 5.196, and sqrt(38) is about 6.164, which adds up to approximately 11.360.\n\nSo, yes, the first expression is larger.\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps I can approach this algebraically instead of numerically, to see if the same conclusion holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions to compare them without dealing with the square roots.\n\nLet me denote the first expression as A ="

Since both are sums of square roots, maybe I can find some relationship or manipulate them algebraically to compare them.\n\nOne strategy I remember is squaring both expressions and comparing the results. If I square A and B, I can compare those results. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with Expression A:\n\nA² = (sqrt(5) + sqrt(35))²\n\nUsing the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²:\n\nA² = (sqrt(5))² + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(35) + (sqrt(35))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- (sqrt(5))² = 5\n- (sqrt(35))² = 35\n- 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(35) = 2*sqrt(5*35) = 2*sqrt(175)\n\nSo, A² = 5 + 35 + 2*sqrt(175) = 40 + 2*sqrt(175)\n\nSimplifying sqrt(175): 175 = 25*7, so sqrt(175) = 5*sqrt(7). Therefore:\n\nA² = 40 + 2*(5*sqrt(7)) = 40 + 10*sqrt(7)\n\nOkay, moving on to Expression B:\n\nB² = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(33))²\n\nAgain, using (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(14))² + 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(33) + (sqrt(33))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- (sqrt(14))² = 14\n- (sqrt(33))² = 33\n- 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(33) = 2*sqrt(14*33) = 2*sqrt(462)\n\nSo, B² = 14 + 33 + 2*sqrt(462) = 47 + 2*sqrt(462)\n\nSimplifying sqrt(462): 462 is 6*77 or 6*7*11, which doesn't simplify further, so sqrt(462) remains as is.\n\nTherefore, B² = 47 + 2*sqrt(462)\n\nNow, we have A² = 40 + 10*sqrt(7) and B² = 47 + 2*sqrt(462). To compare A and B, I can compare A² and B².\n\nBut wait, 10*sqrt(7) is approximately 10*2.6458 = 26.458, so A² ≈ 40 + 26.458 ≈ 66.458.\n\nOn the other hand, sqrt(462) is approximately sqrt(441 + 21) = sqrt(441 + 21) ≈ 21.5, so 2*sqrt(462) ≈ 43. Therefore, B² ≈ 47 + 43 = 90.\n\nWait, that can't be right because sqrt(462) is actually a bit more than 21.5, so 2*sqrt(462) is a bit more than 43.\n\nSo, B² ≈ 47 + 43.5 ≈ 90.5\n\nBut A² is approximately 66.458, which is less than 90.5. So, that suggests that B² is larger than A², which would mean B is larger than A.\n\nBut let me make sure because sometimes when you approximate, you might get confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the exact values numerically with more precision.\n\nLet's compute A² and B² precisely.\n\nFirst, let's compute A² = 40 + 10*sqrt(7). sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6457513110645906.\n\nTherefore, 10*sqrt(7) ≈ 26.457513110645906.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 40 + 26.457513110645906 ≈ 66.45751311064591\n\nNow, B² = 47 + 2*sqrt(462). Let's compute sqrt(462). 462 is between 441 (21²) and 484 (22²). Let's see, 21.5² = 462.25. So, sqrt(462) is just a tiny bit less than 21.5, specifically sqrt(462) ≈ 21.49436941422335.\n\nThus, 2*sqrt(462) ≈ 42.9887388284467.\n\nTherefore, B² ≈ 47 + 42.9887388284467 ≈ 89.9887388284467\n\nSo, A² ≈ 66.4575 and B² ≈ 89.9887, so clearly B² is larger.\n\nTherefore, since B² > A², it must be that B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(14) + sqrt(33) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(35).\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(14) + sqrt(33), which can be written as sqrt(14) + sqrt(33). So, in the required form, it's \\boxed{\\sqrt{14} + \\sqrt{33}}.\n\nBut wait, let me just double-check my calculations because sometimes the approximations can be misleading. Maybe A² and B² are both close to each other, but B² is just barely larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compare them without squaring, perhaps by estimating the square roots.\n\nAnother approach might be to approximate each square root and add them.\n\nCompute sqrt(5) ≈ 2.2360679775\n\nCompute sqrt(35) ≈ 5.9160797831\n\nSo, Expression A ≈ 2.2360679775 + 5.9160797831 ≈ 8.1521477606\n\nCompute sqrt(14) ≈ 3.7416573867\n\nCompute sqrt(33) ≈ 5.7445626490\n\nSo, Expression B ≈ 3.7416573867 + 5.7445626490 ≈ 9.4862200357\n\nComparing these approximate values: 8.1521 vs 9.4862. Clearly, 9.4862 > 8.1521, so Expression B is larger.\n\nTherefore, this confirms that Expression B is larger than Expression A.\n\nAlternatively, another method could be to consider the difference between B and A. If I can show that B - A is positive, then B is larger.\n\nCompute B - A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(33) - sqrt(5) - sqrt(35)\n\nBut that might be messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can write both expressions with similar terms.\n\nWait, sqrt(35) is sqrt(5*7), and sqrt(33) is sqrt(11*3). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, think of sqrt(35) as sqrt(5 + 30), but that doesn't directly help.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I can pair the terms differently.\n\nLet me think: sqrt(14) is sqrt(2*7), and sqrt(33) is sqrt(3*11). Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to express sqrt(35) and sqrt(33) in terms of sqrt(5) and sqrt(7) and sqrt(11) and sqrt(3)?\n\nHmm, perhaps not directly. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, consider that both expressions are sums of square roots, so maybe I can consider their approximate values as I did before, which seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) and sqrt(7) + sqrt(35). And then, I have to figure out which one is larger, and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me just write down both expressions to have them clear in front of me.\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(4) + sqrt(42)\n\nExpression 2: sqrt(7) + sqrt(35)\n\nAlright, so I need to compare these two. I think a good way to approach this is to compute the numerical values of each expression and then see which one is larger. That should be straightforward, right? Unless I'm making some calculation mistake, but let me take it step by step.\n\nStarting with Expression 1: sqrt(4) + sqrt(42)\n\nI know that sqrt(4) is 2 because 2 squared is 4. That part is easy. Now, sqrt(42) is a bit trickier. Let me remember that 6 squared is 36, 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(42) must be somewhere between 6 and 7. Let me try to approximate it. Maybe I can use a calculator for a more precise estimate, but since I don't have one handy, let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that sqrt(42) = sqrt(6*7). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Wait, maybe I can express 42 as 21*2, but that also doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of 42 as 25 + 17, but that seems random. Maybe I can use the linear approximation or the binomial expansion for sqrt(42). Let me recall the binomial approximation formula.\n\nThe binomial expansion for sqrt(x) around x = a is given by:\n\nsqrt(a + h) ≈ sqrt(a) + (h)/(2*sqrt(a)) - (h^2)/(8*a^(3/2)) + ...\n\nSo, if I take a = 36, which is 6^2, and h = 6, then sqrt(42) would be sqrt(36 + 6). So, applying the binomial approximation:\n\nsqrt(42) ≈ sqrt(36) + (6)/(2*sqrt(36)) - (6^2)/(8*(sqrt(36))^3)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nsqrt(36) = 6\n\nSo, the first term is 6.\n\nThe second term is (6)/(2*6) = (6)/(12) = 0.5\n\nThe third term is (36)/(8*216) = (36)/(1728) = 1/48 ≈ 0.0208333\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nsqrt(42) ≈ 6 + 0.5 - 0.0208333 ≈ 6.4791666\n\nHmm, so approximately 6.479. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe my approximation isn't precise enough. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that sqrt(42) is approximately 6.4807. Let me verify that.\n\nYes, I think that's right. So, sqrt(42) is approximately 6.4807.\n\nTherefore, Expression 1: sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) ≈ 2 + 6.4807 ≈ 8.4807\n\nAlright, moving on to Expression 2: sqrt(7) + sqrt(35)\n\nAgain, let's compute each term.\n\nsqrt(7) is approximately... I remember sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(4) is 2, so sqrt(7) is somewhere between 2 and 3. Let's try to approximate it.\n\nUsing the same binomial approximation method, taking a = 4, h = 3, so sqrt(7) = sqrt(4 + 3)\n\nApplying the binomial expansion:\n\nsqrt(4 + 3) ≈ sqrt(4) + (3)/(2*sqrt(4)) - (3^2)/(8*(sqrt(4))^3)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nsqrt(4) = 2\n\nSecond term: 3/(2*2) = 3/4 = 0.75\n\nThird term: 9/(8*8) = 9/64 ≈ 0.140625\n\nSo, sqrt(7) ≈ 2 + 0.75 - 0.140625 ≈ 2.609375\n\nAlternatively, I know that sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458. So, 2.6458 is a more accurate approximation.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(35). Let's do the same.\n\nsqrt(35) is between sqrt(25) = 5 and sqrt(36) = 6. Let me use a = 25, h = 10.\n\nWait, that might be a bit too large. Wait, sqrt(35) is 5.91607, but maybe I need to use a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, using the same binomial expansion.\n\nsqrt(35) = sqrt(25 + 10)\n\nSo, let me use a = 25, h = 10.\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(25 + 10) ≈ sqrt(25) + (10)/(2*sqrt(25)) - (10^2)/(8*(sqrt(25))^3)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nsqrt(25) = 5\n\nSecond term: 10/(2*5) = 10/10 = 1\n\nThird term: 100/(8*125) = 100/1000 = 0.1\n\nSo, sqrt(35) ≈ 5 + 1 - 0.1 = 5.9\n\nBut, let me check with a calculator. sqrt(35) is approximately 5.91607, so 5.916 is a more accurate approximation.\n\nTherefore, Expression 2: sqrt(7) + sqrt(35) ≈ 2.6458 + 5.91607 ≈ 8.56187\n\nComparing both results:\n\nExpression 1: ≈8.4807\n\nExpression 2: ≈8.56187\n\nSo, Expression 2 is larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(7) + sqrt(35) is larger than sqrt(4) + sqrt(42). So, the larger number is sqrt(7) + sqrt(35), which can be written as sqrt(7) + sqrt(35).\n\nWait, before I conclude, let me make sure that my approximations weren't off by much. Let me check:\n\nExpression 1: 2 + 6.4807 = 8.4807\n\nExpression 2: 2.6458 + 5.91607 = 8.56187\n\nSo, 8.56187 is indeed larger than 8.4807. So, yes, Expression 2 is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of another way to compare these expressions without approximating so much.\n\nI remember that for positive numbers a and b, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) can sometimes be compared by squaring both expressions and then comparing the squares. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(42) = 2 + sqrt(42)\n\nLet B = sqrt(7) + sqrt(35)\n\nI can compute A^2 and B^2 and see which one is larger.\n\nCompute A^2:\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(4) + sqrt(42))^2 = (sqrt(4))^2 + 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(4))^2 = 4\n\n2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(42) = 2*2*sqrt(42) = 4*sqrt(42)\n\n(sqrt(42))^2 = 42\n\nSo, A^2 = 4 + 4*sqrt(42) + 42 = 46 + 4*sqrt(42)\n\nSimilarly, compute B^2:\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(35))^2 = (sqrt(7))^2 + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(35) + (sqrt(35))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(7))^2 = 7\n\n2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(35) = 2*sqrt(7*35) = 2*sqrt(245)\n\n(sqrt(35))^2 = 35\n\nSo, B^2 = 7 + 2*sqrt(245) + 35 = 42 + 2*sqrt(245)\n\nNow, to compare A^2 and B^2, which"

Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute each part individually. Starting with sqrt(9). I know that 9 is a perfect square because 3 times 3 is 9. So, sqrt(9) is just 3. That part was straightforward.\n\nNext, let me compute sqrt(25). Similarly, 25 is a perfect square since 5 times 5 is 25. Therefore, sqrt(25) is 5. So, adding those two together, sqrt(9) + sqrt(25) equals 3 + 5, which is 8. Okay, so the first expression simplifies to 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(10) + sqrt(15). Hmm, these aren't perfect squares, so I need to compute their approximate values. Let me recall that sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(10) should be somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me approximate it. I know that 3.1 squared is 9.61, which is less than 10. 3.2 squared is 10.24, which is a bit more than 10. So, sqrt(10) is approximately 3.162. I can write that as approximately 3.162.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(15). Let me think about that. I know that 3.8 squared is 14.44, which is less than 15. 3.9 squared is 15.21, which is just a bit more than 15. So, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872. I can write that as approximately 3.872.\n\nSo, adding sqrt(10) and sqrt(15), I get approximately 3.162 + 3.872. Let me add those together. 3.162 plus 3.872 is... 3 + 3 is 6, 0.162 + 0.872 is 1.034, so total is 7.034. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 3.162 + 3.872.\n\nStarting from the right: 2 + 2 is 4, 6 + 7 is 13, carryover 1. 1 + 1 and the carried over 1 is 3. Then, the integer part: 3 + 3 is 6. So, total is 7.034. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, sqrt(10) + sqrt(15) is approximately 7.034, and sqrt(9) + sqrt(25) is exactly 8. Comparing these two, 8 is clearly larger than 7.034.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make any approximation errors. Maybe I can get a more precise value for sqrt(10) and sqrt(15). Let me recall that 3.16227766 is a known approximation for sqrt(10). Similarly, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872983346.\n\nSo, adding these together using their approximate decimal values: 3.16227766 + 3.872983346. Let me add those:\n\n3.16227766 + 3.872983346\n\nAdding the decimal parts: 0.16227766 + 0.872983346 = 1.035261006\n\nAdding the integer parts: 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, total is 6 + 1.035261006 = 7.035261006\n\nSo, approximately 7.035261006.\n\nAnd sqrt(9) + sqrt(25) is exactly 8, which is 8.000000000.\n\nComparing 7.035261006 and 8.000000000, it is clear that 8 is larger.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me cross-verify. Alternatively, I can compute sqrt(10) + sqrt(15) more accurately.\n\nWait, sqrt(10) is about 3.16227766, sqrt(15) is about 3.872983346.\n\nAdding them: 3.16227766 + 3.872983346. Let's calculate this step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n6 + 6 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n7 + 4 = 11, plus the carried 1 is 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4, plus the carried 1 is 5.\n\n6 + 8 = 14, write down 4, carryover 1.\n\n1 + 7 = 8, plus the carried 1 is 9.\n\n3 + 3 = 6.\n\nSo, the total is 7.035261006.\n\nSo, exact value is approximately 7.035261006.\n\nWhich is less than 8.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(9) + sqrt(25) is 8, which is larger than sqrt(10) + sqrt(15) which is approximately 7.035.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(9) + sqrt(25), which is 8. But the problem asks me to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, since 8 is equal to sqrt(9) + sqrt(25), but also, wait, is that the only way to write it?\n\nWait, but 8 is 8.000000000, which is also equal to sqrt(64) + sqrt(0), but that seems trivial. Alternatively, maybe I can express 8 as sqrt(64) + sqrt(0), but that might not be the intended form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to express 8 as a sum of square roots of positive integers. Let me think.\n\nWait, 8 is equal to sqrt(64) + sqrt(0), which is 8 + 0 = 8. Alternatively, 8 is also sqrt(49) + sqrt(9) = 7 + 3 = 10, which is not 8. Wait, 64 + 0 is 64, whose sqrt is 8.\n\nAlternatively, 8 is sqrt(9) + sqrt(25), which is 3 + 5 = 8. So, that's the straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, can I write 8 as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) where a and b are positive integers not necessarily 9 and 25? Probably, but I think in the context of the problem, they probably expect the same pair, but let me check.\n\nWait, maybe 8 can be written as sqrt(16) + sqrt(4), which is 4 + 2 = 6, which is less than 8. Or sqrt(25) + sqrt(9) which is 5 + 3 = 8, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(16) + sqrt(25) is 4 + 5 = 9, which is more than 8. So, 9 is larger.\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(36) + sqrt(0) is 6 + 0 = 6, which is less than 8.\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(100) + sqrt(64) is 10 + 8 = 18, which is way more than 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe non-integer a and b. But the problem specifies sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) where a and b are under the square roots, so I think they must be integers.\n\nTherefore, 8 can only be expressed as sqrt(9) + sqrt(25). So, I think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different expression. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the two expressions and see if one is larger than the other without computing the exact values.\n\nLet me denote Expression 1 as sqrt(9) + sqrt(25) = 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nExpression 2 as sqrt(10) + sqrt(15). I can compute sqrt(10) and sqrt(15) in another way.\n\nWait, let's see. sqrt(10) squared is 10, sqrt(15) squared is 15. So, 10 + 15 is 25, but that's"

Let me recall the square roots I know:\n\n- sqrt(1) = 1\n- sqrt(4) = 2\n- sqrt(9) = 3\n- sqrt(16) = 4\n- sqrt(25) = 5\n\nSo, sqrt(7) is somewhere between 2 and 3 because 2^2 is 4 and 3^2 is 9. Maybe around 2.64? Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nsqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458. Yeah, I remember that from somewhere. Similarly, sqrt(17) is a bit higher. Let me see, sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(17) is just a bit more than 4, maybe 4.1231.\n\nSo, sqrt(7) + sqrt(17) is approximately 2.6458 + 4.1231, which is about 6.7689.\n\nNow, let me compute sqrt(8) + sqrt(9). sqrt(8) is between 2 and 3, specifically sqrt(8) is about 2.8284. And sqrt(9) is 3, so adding those together: 2.8284 + 3 = 5.8284.\n\nComparing the two, 6.7689 is definitely larger than 5.8284. So, sqrt(7) + sqrt(17) is larger.\n\nWait, but I feel like I should confirm this without approximations, maybe by squaring both expressions. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(7) + sqrt(17) and B = sqrt(8) + sqrt(9). I need to see if A > B or not.\n\nTo compare A and B, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and compare them. If A^2 > B^2, then A > B; if A^2 < B^2, then A < B.\n\nCalculating A^2:\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(17))^2 = (sqrt(7))^2 + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(17) + (sqrt(17))^2 = 7 + 2*sqrt(119) + 17 = 24 + 2*sqrt(119).\n\nSimilarly, B^2:\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(9))^2 = (sqrt(8))^2 + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(9) + (sqrt(9))^2 = 8 + 2*sqrt(72) + 9 = 17 + 2*sqrt(72).\n\nNow, I need to compare 24 + 2*sqrt(119) and 17 + 2*sqrt(72).\n\nSubtract the constants first: 24 - 17 = 7.\n\nSo, 24 + 2*sqrt(119) - (17 + 2*sqrt(72)) = 7 + 2*(sqrt(119) - sqrt(72)).\n\nSo, I need to determine whether 7 + 2*(sqrt(119) - sqrt(72)) is positive or negative.\n\nCompute sqrt(119) and sqrt(72):\n\n- sqrt(119) is approximately 10.9087.\n- sqrt(72) is approximately 8.4853.\n\nSo, sqrt(119) - sqrt(72) ≈ 10.9087 - 8.4853 ≈ 2.4234.\n\nMultiply that by 2: 2 * 2.4234 ≈ 4.8468.\n\nAdd 7: 7 + 4.8468 ≈ 11.8468, which is positive.\n\nTherefore, A^2 - B^2 ≈ 11.8468 > 0, which means A > B.\n\nSo, that confirms it. sqrt(7) + sqrt(17) is larger than sqrt(8) + sqrt(9).\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify the approximate values again.\n\nsqrt(7) ≈ 2.6458, sqrt(17) ≈ 4.1231. Adding them: 2.6458 + 4.1231 ≈ 6.7689.\n\nsqrt(8) ≈ 2.8284, sqrt(9) = 3. Adding them: 2.8284 + 3 ≈ 5.8284.\n\nYes, 6.7689 is indeed larger than 5.8284.\n\nAlternatively, I can also think about the properties of square roots. Since both sqrt(7) and sqrt(17) are larger than sqrt(8) and sqrt(9) respectively, their sum should be larger as well. But that's more of an intuitive approach rather than a precise calculation.\n\nAnother way is to consider that sqrt(7) is less than sqrt(8), but sqrt(17) is greater than sqrt(9). So, it's a trade-off between adding a smaller number and a larger one. But the larger number, sqrt(17), is more significant in contributing to the total sum, so the overall sum of sqrt(7) + sqrt(17) should be larger than sqrt(8) + sqrt(9).\n\nSo, through multiple methods—calculating approximate decimal values, squaring both sums to compare, and considering the properties of square roots—I've arrived at the conclusion that sqrt(7) + sqrt(17) is indeed larger.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The key idea was to compare the sums without necessarily calculating the exact expressions, either by squaring or by estimating.

Let me write that down.\n\nLet’s denote:\nA = sqrt(6) + sqrt(35)\nB = sqrt(21) + sqrt(22)\n\nIf I square both A and B, I can compare them more easily. So, let's compute A² and B².\n\nCalculating A²:\nA² = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(35))²\nUsing the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so:\nA² = (sqrt(6))² + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(35) + (sqrt(35))²\nSimplify each term:\n= 6 + 2*sqrt(6*35) + 35\n= 6 + 2*sqrt(210) + 35\nCombine like terms:\n= 41 + 2*sqrt(210)\n\nNow calculating B²:\nB² = (sqrt(21) + sqrt(22))²\nAgain, using the same formula:\nB² = (sqrt(21))² + 2*sqrt(21)*sqrt(22) + (sqrt(22))²\nSimplify each term:\n= 21 + 2*sqrt(21*22) + 22\nCombine like terms:\n= 43 + 2*sqrt(462)\n\nOkay, so now I have A² = 41 + 2*sqrt(210) and B² = 43 + 2*sqrt(462). To compare A and B, I can compare A² and B² because if A² > B², then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's compute the difference between B² and A²:\nB² - A² = (43 + 2*sqrt(462)) - (41 + 2*sqrt(210))\n= 2 + 2*sqrt(462) - 2*sqrt(210)\n\nHmm, now I need to figure out whether B² - A² is positive or negative. If it is positive, then B > A; if it's negative, then A > B.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n2 + 2*sqrt(462) - 2*sqrt(210)\n\nLet me factor out the 2:\n2*(1 + sqrt(462) - sqrt(210))\n\nSo, the question is whether 1 + sqrt(462) - sqrt(210) is positive or negative.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(462) and sqrt(210) approximately to see.\n\nI know that sqrt(400) is 20, sqrt(441) is 21, sqrt(484) is 22, so sqrt(462) is somewhere around 21.5. Similarly, sqrt(210) is around 14.49, because 14² is 196 and 15² is 225.\n\nSo plugging in approximate values:\nsqrt(462) ≈ 21.5\nsqrt(210) ≈ 14.49\n\nSo, substituting back into 1 + sqrt(462) - sqrt(210):\n1 + 21.5 - 14.49 ≈ 1 + 21.5 = 22.5; 22.5 - 14.49 ≈ 8.01\n\nSo, the expression inside the parentheses is approximately 8.01, which is positive. Therefore, 2*(positive) is positive, so B² - A² is positive. Therefore, B² > A², which means that B > A.\n\nSo, sqrt(21) + sqrt(22) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(35). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(21) + sqrt(22).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me just verify my approximations because sometimes my estimates might be too rough. Maybe I can be more precise.\n\nCalculating sqrt(462):\n\n21² = 441, 22² = 484.\n\n462 - 441 = 21; so sqrt(462) is 21 + 21/(2*21) approximately, using the linear approximation.\n\nWait, that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 21.5² = (21 + 0.5)² = 21² + 2*21*0.5 + 0.5² = 441 + 21 + 0.25 = 462.25\n\nOh, interesting. So 21.5² = 462.25, which is just a bit more than 462. So sqrt(462) is just a little less than 21.5, maybe 21.499.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(210):\n\n14² = 196, 15²=225, so sqrt(210) is 14 + (210 - 196)/ (2*14 +1 ) approximately.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, 14.49²:\n\n14.49² = (14 + 0.49)² = 14² + 2*14*0.49 + 0.49² = 196 + 13.72 + 0.2401 = 196 + 13.72 = 209.72 + 0.2401 ≈ 209.9601\n\nWhich is just a bit less than 210, so sqrt(210) is just a bit more than 14.49, maybe 14.492 or something.\n\nSo, going back:\n\n1 + sqrt(462) - sqrt(210) ≈ 1 + 21.499 - 14.492 ≈ 1 + 21.499 = 22.499 - 14.492 ≈ 8.007\n\nWhich is positive, so 8.007, so 2*8.007 is 16.014. So B² - A² ≈ 16.014, which is positive.\n\nTherefore, B² is definitely greater than A², so B > A.\n\nWait, so that means sqrt(21) + sqrt(22) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(35). So, the larger number is sqrt(21) + sqrt(22).\n\nWait a second, but just to make sure, let me compute both A and B numerically to have an exact idea.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(6) + sqrt(35):\n\nsqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495\n\nsqrt(35) ≈ 5.9161\n\nSo, A ≈ 2.4495 + 5.9161 ≈ 8.3656\n\nCompute B = sqrt(21) + sqrt(22):\n\nsqrt(21) ≈ 4.5837\n\nsqrt(22) ≈ 4.6904\n\nSo, B ≈ 4.5837 + 4.6904 ≈ 9.2741\n\nComparing A ≈ 8.3656 and B ≈ 9.2741, indeed, B is larger.\n\nSo, sqrt(21) + sqrt(22) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(35). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(21) + sqrt(22).\n\nWait, but let me see if I can find another way of comparing them. Maybe without squaring, but using some other method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compare the two expressions by seeing which one is bigger. Let me note that sqrt(21) is sqrt(3*7), and sqrt(22) is sqrt(2*11). Whereas sqrt(6) is sqrt(2*3), and sqrt(35) is sqrt(5*7). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the difference between B and A.\n\nCompute B - A:\n\nsqrt(21) + sqrt(22) - sqrt(6) - sqrt(35)\n\nIt's the same as (sqrt(21) -"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(2) + sqrt(22) is larger than sqrt(8) + sqrt(17) or vice versa. Hmm, let me start by writing down both expressions to get a clear view.\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(2) + sqrt(22)\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(8) + sqrt(17)\n\nI wonder if I can simplify or approximate these values to compare them. Maybe I can calculate each square root and then add them up. But I remember that square roots of integers don't usually result in integers, so the sums might be tricky to compare directly.\n\nLet me try to approximate each term.\n\nStarting with sqrt(2). I know that sqrt(1) is 1 and sqrt(4) is 2, so sqrt(2) should be somewhere between 1 and 2. More precisely, it's approximately 1.4142.\n\nNext, sqrt(8). Since 8 is 4 times 2, sqrt(8) is sqrt(4*2) which is 2*sqrt(2). We already have sqrt(2) approximated as 1.4142, so 2*1.4142 is about 2.8284.\n\nNow, sqrt(22). Hmm, 22 is between 16 and 25, so sqrt(22) should be between 4 and 5. Let me get a better estimate. Since 4.7 squared is 22.09, which is just a bit over 22, so sqrt(22) is approximately 4.6904.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(17). 16 is 4 squared, so sqrt(17) is a little more than 4. Let's see, 4.1 squared is 16.81, which is less than 17, and 4.15 squared is 17.2225, which is more than 17. So sqrt(17) is approximately 4.1231.\n\nOkay, so now I have:\n\nsqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142\n\nsqrt(8) ≈ 2.8284\n\nsqrt(22) ≈ 4.6904\n\nsqrt(17) ≈ 4.1231\n\nNow, let's compute the sums.\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(2) + sqrt(22) ≈ 1.4142 + 4.6904 ≈ 6.1046\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(8) + sqrt(17) ≈ 2.8284 + 4.1231 ≈ 6.9515\n\nWait, hold on, 6.1046 is less than 6.9515. So according to my approximations, sqrt(8) + sqrt(17) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(22). But that seems counterintuitive because 8 and 17 are both larger numbers under the square roots, but in this case, their sum ends up being larger than the other two.\n\nLet me double-check my approximations because 4.1231 for sqrt(17) and 4.6904 for sqrt(22) seem reasonable, but maybe I can find a more accurate way to compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(17) and sqrt(2) + sqrt(22) without approximating each term individually.\n\nAnother approach is to square both expressions and compare the results. That might help me avoid dealing with more complicated decimals.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(2) + sqrt(22) and B = sqrt(8) + sqrt(17). I want to compare A and B, so I can look at A² and B².\n\nCompute A²:\n\nA² = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(22))² = (sqrt(2))² + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(22) + (sqrt(22))² = 2 + 2*sqrt(44) + 22 = 24 + 2*sqrt(44)\n\nCompute B²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(17))² = (sqrt(8))² + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(17) + (sqrt(17))² = 8 + 2*sqrt(136) + 17 = 25 + 2*sqrt(136)\n\nSo, now I need to compare A² and B², which are 24 + 2*sqrt(44) and 25 + 2*sqrt(136). Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(44) and sqrt(136). Since 44 is between 36 and 49, sqrt(44) is between 6 and 7. Similarly, 136 is between 121 (11²) and 144 (12²), so sqrt(136) is between 11 and 12.\n\nCalculating more precisely:\n\nsqrt(44): 6.6332 (since 6.6332² ≈ 44)\n\nsqrt(136): 11.6619 (since 11.6619² ≈ 136)\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nA² ≈ 24 + 2*6.6332 ≈ 24 + 13.2664 ≈ 37.2664\n\nB² ≈ 25 + 2*11.6619 ≈ 25 + 23.3238 ≈ 48.3238\n\nSo, A² ≈ 37.2664 and B² ≈ 48.3238. Therefore, B² > A², which implies that B > A. So, sqrt(8) + sqrt(17) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(22).\n\nBut wait, when I approximated the sums earlier, I got A ≈ 6.1046 and B ≈ 6.9515, so that supports the conclusion that B is larger. So, the sqrt(8) + sqrt(17) is larger.\n\nBut let me think a bit more. Is there another way to compare sqrt(2) + sqrt(22) and sqrt(8) + sqrt(17) without squaring? Maybe by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference between the two sums and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nLet me compute B - A:\n\nB - A = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(17)) - (sqrt(2) + sqrt(22)) = (sqrt(8) - sqrt(2)) + (sqrt(17) - sqrt(22))\n\nI can compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: sqrt(8) - sqrt(2) = 2*sqrt(2) - sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142\n\nSecond term: sqrt(17) - sqrt(22) ≈ 4.1231 - 4.6904 ≈ -0.5673\n\nSo, adding them together: 1.4142 - 0.5673 ≈ 0.8469\n\nSo, the difference B - A is approximately 0.8469, which is positive. Therefore, B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(8) + sqrt(17) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(22). So, the larger number is sqrt(8) + sqrt(17).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe rationalizing or comparing term by term.\n\nLet me write both expressions:\n\nA = sqrt(2) + sqrt(22)\n\nB = sqrt(8) + sqrt(17)\n\nI can think of them as:\n\nA = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2*11) = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)*sqrt(11) = sqrt(2)(1 + sqrt(11))\n\nSimilarly, B = sqrt(8) + sqrt(17) = 2*sqrt(2) + sqrt(17)\n\nSo, A = sqrt(2)(1 + sqrt(11)) and B = 2*sqrt(2) + sqrt(17)\n\nNot sure if that helps, but maybe I can consider the ratios.\n\nCompute A/B:\n\nA/B = [sqrt(2) + sqrt(22)] / [sqrt(8) + sqrt(17)]\n\nHmm, that might not be straightforward to compute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can square both A and B and see which is larger.\n\nWait, I actually did that earlier. So, if A² ≈ 37.2664 and B² ≈ 48.3238, so B² is larger.\n\nTherefore, B is larger than A.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to consider the difference between B and A and show that it's positive.\n\nWait, I already did that by computing the approximate difference. So, the difference is positive,"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to compare sqrt(14) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(28) + sqrt(35). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should simplify each expression as much as possible. Let me start with the first one: sqrt(14) + sqrt(49). I know that sqrt(49) is a whole number because 49 is a perfect square. Specifically, sqrt(49) is 7. So, that part is easy. So, the first expression simplifies to sqrt(14) + 7.\n\nNow, the second expression is sqrt(28) + sqrt(35). Hmm, neither of those is a perfect square, so I might need to see if they can be simplified further or perhaps compare them numerically. But before I do that, maybe there's another way to compare sqrt(14) + 7 and sqrt(28) + sqrt(35) without computing their exact decimal values.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can pair the terms differently. For example, sqrt(14) is sqrt(2*7), and sqrt(28) is sqrt(4*7), which is 2*sqrt(7). Similarly, sqrt(35) is sqrt(5*7). Maybe there's a common factor or something I can factor out?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express both sums in terms of sqrt(7). Let me try that. Let's denote sqrt(7) as a variable, say, s. Then, sqrt(14) is s*sqrt(2), and sqrt(28) is s*sqrt(4) which is 2s. Similarly, sqrt(35) is sqrt(5)*s. So, the expressions become:\n\nFirst expression: s*sqrt(2) + 7\nSecond expression: 2s + s*sqrt(5)\n\nSo, now I have sqrt(14) + sqrt(49) as s*sqrt(2) + 7, and sqrt(28) + sqrt(35) as 2s + s*sqrt(5). Hmm, I wonder if I can compare these two expressions by factoring s out or something.\n\nLet me write both expressions with s:\n\nFirst: s*sqrt(2) + 7\nSecond: s*(2 + sqrt(5))\n\nSo, now, perhaps I can see which is larger, s*sqrt(2) + 7 vs. s*(2 + sqrt(5)). Let's subtract one from the other to see the difference.\n\nLet me compute (2 + sqrt(5)) - sqrt(2). If this is positive, then the second expression is larger, and vice versa.\n\nCalculating 2 + sqrt(5): sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, so 2 + 2.236 is about 4.236.\n\nThen, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414.\n\nSo, 4.236 - 1.414 is about 2.822. So, this is positive. That means (2 + sqrt(5)) - sqrt(2) is positive, so the second expression is larger.\n\nWait, so does that mean that sqrt(28) + sqrt(35) is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(49)?\n\nLet me double-check my steps because that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerical values of the expressions:\n\nCompute sqrt(14): sqrt(14) is about 3.7417, and sqrt(49) is 7, so the first sum is 3.7417 + 7 = 10.7417.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(28): sqrt(28) is about 5.2915, and sqrt(35) is about 5.9161, so the second sum is 5.2915 + 5.9161 ≈ 11.2076.\n\nComparing these, 11.2076 is indeed larger than 10.7417. So, that seems to confirm my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but let me see the exact symbolic comparison again. So, I had:\n\nFirst expression: s*sqrt(2) + 7, Second expression: s*(2 + sqrt(5))\n\nSo, the difference is s*(2 + sqrt(5)) - s*sqrt(2) = s*(2 + sqrt(5) - sqrt(2)).\n\nSince s is positive (sqrt(7) is positive), and (2 + sqrt(5) - sqrt(2)) is positive, as I computed approximately 2.822, which is positive, so the second expression is larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(28) + sqrt(35) is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(49).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to square both expressions and compare the results. Since both expressions are positive, their squares will preserve the inequality.\n\nLet me try that approach as a cross-verification.\n\nFirst, let me denote A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(49) = sqrt(14) + 7, and B = sqrt(28) + sqrt(35).\n\nCompute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(14) + 7)^2 = (sqrt(14))^2 + 2*sqrt(14)*7 + 7^2 = 14 + 14*sqrt(14) + 49 = 63 + 14*sqrt(14).\n\nB^2 = (sqrt(28) + sqrt(35))^2 = (sqrt(28))^2 + 2*sqrt(28)*sqrt(35) + (sqrt(35))^2 = 28 + 2*sqrt(28*35) + 35 = 63 + 2*sqrt(980).\n\nSo, now, let's compute sqrt(980): sqrt(980) = sqrt(100*9.8) = 10*sqrt(9.8). Wait, that might not help much. Alternatively, factor 980: 980 = 100*9.8, but 9.8 is 49/5, so sqrt(980) = sqrt(100*49/5) = (10*7)/sqrt(5) = 70/sqrt(5) = 14*sqrt(5). Wait, hold on, let me do that again.\n\nWait, 980 = 100 * 9.8, which is 100 * (49/5). So, sqrt(980) = sqrt(100 * 49 / 5) = sqrt(100) * sqrt(49) / sqrt(5) = 10 * 7 / sqrt(5) = 70 / sqrt(5) = 14*sqrt(5). Wait, that seems correct because 70/sqrt(5) can be rationalized as (70*sqrt(5))/5 = 14*sqrt(5). So, sqrt(980) = 14*sqrt(5).\n\nTherefore, B^2 = 63 + 2*14*sqrt(5) = 63 + 28*sqrt(5).\n\nSimilarly, A^2 = 63 + 14*sqrt(14).\n\nSo, now, comparing A^2 and B^2: 63 + 14*sqrt(14) vs. 63 + 28*sqrt(5).\n\nSubtracting 63 from both, we have 14*sqrt(14) vs. 28*sqrt(5). Dividing both sides by 14, we get sqrt(14) vs. 2*sqrt(5).\n\nSo, is sqrt(14) larger than 2*sqrt(5)? Let's compute both:\n\nsqrt(14) ≈ 3.7417\n2*sqrt(5) ≈ 2*2.23607 ≈ 4.47214\n\nSo, 3.7417 < 4.47214, so sqrt(14) < 2*sqrt(5). Therefore, 14*sqrt(14) < 28*sqrt(5), which implies that A^2 < B^2.\n\nTherefore, since A and B are both positive, A < B.\n\nSo, this confirms that sqrt(28) + sqrt(35) is larger than sqrt(14) + sqrt(49).\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my step when I simplified sqrt(980). Let me recheck that.\n\nsqrt(980): 980 is 100 * 9.8, but perhaps another way to factor it is better. 980 = 49 * 20, since 49*20=980"

Hmm, let me write down both expressions so I can compare them step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute sqrt(5) + sqrt(50). I know that sqrt(50) can be simplified. Let me see, sqrt(50) is the same as sqrt(25*2), which is sqrt(25)*sqrt(2), which is 5*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2). That means sqrt(5) + sqrt(50) is sqrt(5) + 5*sqrt(2). Maybe I can write that as sqrt(5) + 5*sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let me look at the other expression: sqrt(27) + sqrt(30). Similarly, I can try to simplify these. sqrt(27) is sqrt(9*3), which is sqrt(9)*sqrt(3), so that's 3*sqrt(3). And sqrt(30) is sqrt(25*1.2), but that doesn't help me much. Alternatively, I can factor 30 as 10*3, so sqrt(30) is sqrt(10*3), but that's not a perfect square. So, maybe I should leave sqrt(30) as it is for now.\n\nSo, sqrt(27) + sqrt(30) is 3*sqrt(3) + sqrt(30). Hmm, I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I need to rationalize or compare them differently.\n\nWait, another approach could be to square both expressions and compare the results. That might make it easier because squaring should preserve the order if both numbers are positive, which they are here.\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(27) + sqrt(30). Then, A squared is (sqrt(5) + sqrt(50))^2 and B squared is (sqrt(27) + sqrt(30))^2.\n\nCalculating A squared: (sqrt(5) + sqrt(50))^2 = (sqrt(5))^2 + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(50) + (sqrt(50))^2. Similarly, B squared is (sqrt(27) + sqrt(30))^2 = (sqrt(27))^2 + 2*sqrt(27)*sqrt(30) + (sqrt(30))^2.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFor A squared:\n- (sqrt(5))^2 = 5\n- (sqrt(50))^2 = 50\n- The middle term is 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(50). Let's compute that. sqrt(5)*sqrt(50) is sqrt(5*50) = sqrt(250). So, 2*sqrt(250). But sqrt(250) can be simplified as sqrt(25*10) = 5*sqrt(10). So, the middle term becomes 2*5*sqrt(10) = 10*sqrt(10).\n\nTherefore, A squared is 5 + 10*sqrt(10) + 50. That simplifies to 55 + 10*sqrt(10).\n\nFor B squared:\n- (sqrt(27))^2 = 27\n- (sqrt(30))^2 = 30\n- The middle term is 2*sqrt(27)*sqrt(30). Let's compute that. sqrt(27)*sqrt(30) is sqrt(27*30) = sqrt(810). Now, sqrt(810) can be simplified as sqrt(81*10) = 9*sqrt(10). So, the middle term becomes 2*9*sqrt(10) = 18*sqrt(10).\n\nTherefore, B squared is 27 + 18*sqrt(10) + 30. That simplifies to 57 + 18*sqrt(10).\n\nNow, I have A squared = 55 + 10*sqrt(10) and B squared = 57 + 18*sqrt(10). To compare A and B, I need to compare A squared and B squared. Let me compute the difference between B squared and A squared to see which is larger.\n\nB squared - A squared = (57 + 18*sqrt(10)) - (55 + 10*sqrt(10)) = (57 - 55) + (18*sqrt(10) - 10*sqrt(10)) = 2 + 8*sqrt(10).\n\nSince sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623, 8*sqrt(10) is approximately 25.2984. So, 2 + 25.2984 is approximately 27.2984. That's a positive number. Therefore, B squared is greater than A squared. Therefore, B is greater than A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I simplify, I might make a mistake.\n\nLet me recalculate A squared:\n\nsqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, sqrt(50) is approximately 7.071. So, A is approximately 2.236 + 7.071 = 9.307. So, A squared is approximately 9.307^2. Let me compute that: 9^2 is 81, 0.307^2 is about 0.094, and cross term is 2*9*0.307 ≈ 5.526. So, total is approximately 81 + 5.526 + 0.094 ≈ 86.62. So, A squared is approximately 86.62.\n\nNow, B squared: sqrt(27) is approximately 5.196, sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477. So, B is approximately 5.196 + 5.477 ≈ 10.673. Then, squaring that: 10^2 is 100, 0.673^2 is about 0.453, cross term is 2*10*0.673 ≈ 13.46. So, total is approximately 100 + 13.46 + 0.453 ≈ 113.913.\n\nSo, A squared is approximately 86.62 and B squared is approximately 113.913. Therefore, B squared is definitely larger than A squared. Therefore, B is larger than A.\n\nSo, sqrt(27) + sqrt(30) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(50). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(27) + sqrt(30). So, I can write that as sqrt(27) + sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make an error in the earlier calculation when I was squaring A and B.\n\nFor A squared: (sqrt(5) + sqrt(50))^2. Let me compute it again:\n\nsqrt(5)^2 is 5.\n\nsqrt(50)^2 is 50.\n\nMiddle term: 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(50). sqrt(5)*sqrt(50) is sqrt(250), which is 5*sqrt(10). So, 2*5*sqrt(10) is 10*sqrt(10). So, A squared is 5 + 10*sqrt(10) + 50, which is 55 + 10*sqrt(10). That seems correct.\n\nFor B squared: (sqrt(27) + sqrt(30))^2. sqrt(27)^2 is 27, sqrt(30)^2 is 30, middle term is 2*sqrt(27)*sqrt(30). sqrt(27) is 3*sqrt(3), sqrt(30) is sqrt(30). So, 2*3*sqrt(3)*sqrt(30) is 6*sqrt(90). Wait, hold on, that's different from what I did before.\n\nWait, earlier I simplified sqrt(27)*sqrt(30) as sqrt(810), but now I see that 2*sqrt(27)*sqrt(30) is 2*sqrt(810). But sqrt(810) is sqrt(81*10) which is 9*sqrt(10). So, 2*sqrt(810) is 2*9*sqrt(10) which is 18*sqrt(10). So, same as before. So, B squared is 27 + 30 + 18*sqrt(10) which is 57 + 18"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(4) + sqrt(30) and sqrt(14) + sqrt(27). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they aren't linear, so I can't just add them up directly. I need a different strategy. Maybe I can square both expressions and then compare them? That might work because squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, so if one expression is larger, its square will also be larger, and vice versa. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let me write down both expressions:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(4) + sqrt(30)\n\nExpression B: sqrt(14) + sqrt(27)\n\nAlright, so I need to square both A and B and then see which one is larger.\n\nLet's compute the square of Expression A first.\n\nExpression A squared: (sqrt(4) + sqrt(30))^2\n\nI remember that (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So applying that here:\n\n= (sqrt(4))^2 + 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(30) + (sqrt(30))^2\n\nNow, let's compute each term:\n\n(sqrt(4))^2 = 4, since sqrt(4) is 2, and 2 squared is 4.\n\nSimilarly, (sqrt(30))^2 = 30, since squaring the square root just gives the original number.\n\nNow, the middle term: 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(30). Let's compute that.\n\nsqrt(4) is 2, so that term becomes 2*2*sqrt(30) = 4*sqrt(30). Hmm, okay.\n\nSo putting it all together, Expression A squared is:\n\n4 + 4*sqrt(30) + 30\n\nCombine the constants: 4 + 30 = 34\n\nSo Expression A squared is 34 + 4*sqrt(30)\n\nNow, let's compute Expression B squared.\n\nExpression B squared: (sqrt(14) + sqrt(27))^2\n\nAgain, using the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n\nSo:\n\n= (sqrt(14))^2 + 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(27) + (sqrt(27))^2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(sqrt(14))^2 = 14\n\n(sqrt(27))^2 = 27\n\nThe middle term: 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(27). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417, and sqrt(27) is approximately 5.1962. But wait, I might not need to approximate them. Let me see if I can express this in terms of radicals.\n\nsqrt(14)*sqrt(27) = sqrt(14*27) = sqrt(378). Hmm, 378 can be factored into 9*42, which is 9*6*7. So sqrt(378) = sqrt(9*42) = 3*sqrt(42). Therefore, 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(27) = 2*3*sqrt(42) = 6*sqrt(42).\n\nLet me note that down: 6*sqrt(42)\n\nSo putting it all together, Expression B squared is:\n\n14 + 6*sqrt(42) + 27\n\nCombine the constants: 14 + 27 = 41\n\nSo Expression B squared is 41 + 6*sqrt(42)\n\nAlright, so now I have both squared expressions:\n\nExpression A squared: 34 + 4*sqrt(30)\n\nExpression B squared: 41 + 6*sqrt(42)\n\nSo now I need to compare 34 + 4*sqrt(30) and 41 + 6*sqrt(42). Hmm, which one is larger? Let's figure that out.\n\nFirst, let me write both expressions:\n\nLeft side: 34 + 4*sqrt(30)\n\nRight side: 41 + 6*sqrt(42)\n\nTo compare them, maybe I can compute the difference between the right side and the left side:\n\nRight side - Left side = (41 + 6*sqrt(42)) - (34 + 4*sqrt(30)) = (41 - 34) + (6*sqrt(42) - 4*sqrt(30)) = 7 + 6*sqrt(42) - 4*sqrt(30)\n\nSo, if this difference is positive, then the right side is larger; if it's negative, the left side is larger.\n\nSo I need to compute whether 7 + 6*sqrt(42) - 4*sqrt(30) is positive.\n\nHmm, okay, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst, let's compute sqrt(42) and sqrt(30). Maybe I can approximate them to see the difference.\n\nsqrt(42): sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(42) is approximately 6.4807.\n\nsqrt(30): sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(30) is approximately 5.4772.\n\nSo, let's plug those approximate values in.\n\nCompute 6*sqrt(42): 6*6.4807 ≈ 6*6.48 ≈ 38.88\n\nCompute 4*sqrt(30): 4*5.4772 ≈ 4*5.477 ≈ 21.9088\n\nNow, compute 7 + 38.88 - 21.9088.\n\nThat's 7 + 38.88 = 45.88\n\n45.88 - 21.9088 ≈ 23.9712\n\nWhich is positive. So the difference is approximately 23.97, which is positive. Therefore, right side - left side ≈ 23.97 > 0, which means Expression B squared is larger than Expression A squared. So, since squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, Expression B is larger than Expression A.\n\nTherefore, Expression B is sqrt(14) + sqrt(27), so the larger number is sqrt(14) + sqrt(27).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I should check my computations more precisely, just in case I made an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me recompute the approximate values more accurately.\n\nFirst, sqrt(42):\n\n42 is 6.4807407 approx.\n\nSo 6*sqrt(42) = 6*6.4807407 ≈ 38.8844442\n\nsqrt(30):\n\n30 is 5.4772256 approx.\n\nSo 4*sqrt(30) = 4*5.4772256 ≈ 21.9089024\n\nNow, right side - left side = 7 + 38.8844442 - 21.9089024 ≈ 7 + 38.8844442 = 45.8844442 - 21.9089024 ≈ 23.9755418\n\nWhich is positive. So yes, the difference is positive, so Expression B is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare sqrt(14) + sqrt(27) with sqrt(4) + sqrt(30) without squaring, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider if the two expressions can be expressed in a similar form or if one can be rewritten in terms of the other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare sqrt(14) + sqrt(27) vs sqrt(4) + sqrt(30) by considering their approximate decimal values.\n\nLet me compute both Expression A and Expression B numerically.\n\nCompute Expression A: sqrt(4) + sqrt(30)\n\nsqrt(4) is 2.\n\nsqrt(30) is approximately 5.4772256.\n\nSo Expression A ≈ 2 + 5.4772256 ≈ 7.4772256\n\nCompute Expression B: sqrt(14) + sqrt(27)\n\nsqrt(14) is approximately 3.7416573.\n\nsqrt(27) is approximately 5.1961524.\n\nSo Expression B ≈ 3.7416573 + 5.1961524 ≈ 8.9378097\n\nSo numerically, Expression B is approximately 8.9378, which is clearly larger than 7.4772.\n\nSo that's a more straightforward way, but it's using approximate decimal values, which is okay because the"

I need to figure out which one is larger and then write the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help because it can simplify the comparison. Let me denote the two sums as follows:\n\nLet A = sqrt(19) + sqrt(41)\nLet B = sqrt(24) + sqrt(40)\n\nI need to figure out whether A > B or A < B. Since both A and B are sums of square roots, squaring them might make it easier to compare. So, let me compute A² and B².\n\nStarting with A²:\nA² = (sqrt(19) + sqrt(41))²\nI remember that (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y², so applying that here:\nA² = (sqrt(19))² + 2*sqrt(19)*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))²\nCalculating each term:\n= 19 + 2*sqrt(19*41) + 41\nSimplify the constants:\n19 + 41 = 60, so:\nA² = 60 + 2*sqrt(779)\n\nWait, what's 19*41? Let me compute that:\n19*40 = 760, so 19*41 = 760 + 19 = 779. Okay, so that's correct.\n\nNow moving on to B²:\nB² = (sqrt(24) + sqrt(40))²\nAgain, using the same formula:\n= (sqrt(24))² + 2*sqrt(24)*sqrt(40) + (sqrt(40))²\nCalculate each term:\n= 24 + 2*sqrt(24*40) + 40\nSimplify the constants:\n24 + 40 = 64, so:\nB² = 64 + 2*sqrt(960)\n\nHmm, okay. Now I have A² = 60 + 2*sqrt(779) and B² = 64 + 2*sqrt(960). So, to compare A and B, I can compare A² and B².\n\nBut wait, before I proceed, I realize that 2*sqrt(779) is definitely less than 2*sqrt(960) because 779 < 960. So, 2*sqrt(779) < 2*sqrt(960). However, when we add these to their respective constants, the question is whether the increase in sqrt(779) is offset by the increase in sqrt(960).\n\nSo, if I can figure out whether 60 + 2*sqrt(779) is greater than 64 + 2*sqrt(960), that will tell me whether A² is greater than B², which would mean A > B. Alternatively, if A² is less than B², then A < B.\n\nLet me write the inequality:\n\n60 + 2*sqrt(779) ? 64 + 2*sqrt(960)\n\nSubtract 60 from both sides:\n\n2*sqrt(779) ? 4 + 2*sqrt(960)\n\nHmm, that might not be the most straightforward way. Maybe I should move the constants to one side.\n\nAlternatively, subtract 60 from both sides and subtract 64 from both sides:\n\n2*sqrt(779) - 64 ? 2*sqrt(960) - 60\n\nWait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's bring all terms to one side:\n\n60 + 2*sqrt(779) - 64 - 2*sqrt(960) ? 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(60 - 64) + 2*sqrt(779) - 2*sqrt(960) ? 0\nWhich is:\n\n-4 + 2*(sqrt(779) - sqrt(960)) ? 0\n\nSo,\n\n2*(sqrt(779) - sqrt(960)) ? 4\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(779) - sqrt(960) ? 2\n\nSo, now the question is whether sqrt(779) is greater than sqrt(960) + 2.\n\nBut wait, sqrt(960) is a large number. Let me compute sqrt(960) first.\n\nCalculating sqrt(960):\n\nI know that 31² = 961, which is just 1 more than 960. So, sqrt(960) is just a tiny bit less than 31, like 30.98 or something. Let me confirm:\n\n30² = 900\n\n31² = 961\n\nSo, 31² - 1 = 960, so sqrt(960) = sqrt(31² - 1) ≈ 31 - (1)/(2*31) ≈ 31 - 0.016 ≈ 30.984\n\nSo, sqrt(960) ≈ 30.984\n\nThen, sqrt(960) + 2 ≈ 30.984 + 2 ≈ 32.984\n\nNow, sqrt(779):\n\nLet me see, 28² = 784, so sqrt(779) is a bit less than 28.\n\nCompute 28² = 784\n\nSo, 28² - 5 = 779, so sqrt(779) = sqrt(28² - 5) ≈ 28 - (5)/(2*28) ≈ 28 - 0.089 ≈ 27.911\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Wait, 27.911 squared is approximately:\n\n27.911² = (28 - 0.089)² ≈ 28² - 2*28*0.089 + 0.089² ≈ 784 - 5.048 + 0.0079 ≈ 778.959\n\nWhich is very close to 779, so sqrt(779) ≈ 27.911\n\nSo, sqrt(779) ≈ 27.911\n\nSo, sqrt(779) - sqrt(960) ≈ 27.911 - 30.984 ≈ -3.073\n\nMultiply that by 2: 2*(sqrt(779) - sqrt(960)) ≈ -6.146\n\nThen, the inequality was:\n\nsqrt(779) - sqrt(960) ? 2\n\nWhich is:\n\n-3.073 ? 2\n\nWhich is definitely false, since -3.073 is not greater than 2.\n\nTherefore, the inequality -4 + 2*(sqrt(779) - sqrt(960)) ≈ -4 -6.146 ≈ -10.146 is less than 0.\n\nSo, that implies that A² - B² ≈ -10.146 < 0, which means A² < B², so A < B.\n\nWait, but hold on, that seems counterintuitive because 24 and 40 are smaller numbers, so their square roots are smaller, but 19 and 41 are also smaller and larger. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me double-check the steps.\n\nStarting with A² = 60 + 2*sqrt(779)\n\nB² = 64 + 2*sqrt(960)\n\nSo, A² - B² = (60 - 64) + 2*(sqrt(779) - sqrt(960)) = -4 + 2*(sqrt(779) - sqrt(960))\n\nSo, to determine whether A² - B² is positive or negative, we can compute whether sqrt(779) - sqrt(960) is greater than 2 or less than 2.\n\nWe have sqrt(779) ≈ 27.911\n\nsqrt(960) ≈ 30.984\n\nSo, sqrt(779) - sqrt(960) ≈ -3.073\n\nWhich is less than 2.\n\nTherefore, 2*(sqrt(779) - sqrt(960)) ≈ -6.146\n\nSo, A² - B² ≈ -4 -6.146 ≈ -1"

Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help. That might be a good approach here. Let me try that.\n\nLet’s denote the first sum as A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(42) and the second sum as B = sqrt(39) + sqrt(41). I need to compare A and B.\n\nSo, if I square both A and B, I can get rid of the square roots and compare the results more easily. Let me compute A squared and B squared.\n\nStarting with A squared:\nA² = (sqrt(5) + sqrt(42))²\nI know that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so applying that:\nA² = (sqrt(5))² + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))²\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(5))² = 5\n2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(42) = 2*sqrt(5*42) = 2*sqrt(210)\n(sqrt(42))² = 42\nSo, adding them up:\nA² = 5 + 42 + 2*sqrt(210) = 47 + 2*sqrt(210)\n\nNow, let me compute B squared:\nB² = (sqrt(39) + sqrt(41))²\nAgain, using the same formula:\nB² = (sqrt(39))² + 2*sqrt(39)*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))²\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(39))² = 39\n2*sqrt(39)*sqrt(41) = 2*sqrt(39*41) = 2*sqrt(1599)\n(sqrt(41))² = 41\nAdding them up:\nB² = 39 + 41 + 2*sqrt(1599) = 80 + 2*sqrt(1599)\n\nOkay, so now we have A² = 47 + 2*sqrt(210) and B² = 80 + 2*sqrt(1599). To compare A and B, I need to see which is larger between A² and B².\n\nLet me compute the numerical values of these to see which is bigger.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(210). I know that 14² = 196 and 15² = 225, so sqrt(210) is somewhere between 14 and 15. Let me get a better approximation.\n\n14² = 196\n14.5² = 210.25\n\nWait, 14.5² is 210.25, which is just a bit more than 210. So, sqrt(210) ≈ 14.49.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(210) ≈ 2*14.49 ≈ 28.98.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 47 + 28.98 ≈ 75.98.\n\nNow, compute sqrt(1599). Hmm, 40² = 1600, so sqrt(1599) is just a little less than 40. Let's figure this out.\n\n40² = 1600\nSo, 39.9² = (40 - 0.1)² = 40² - 2*40*0.1 + 0.1² = 1600 - 8 + 0.01 = 1592.01\n\nWait, that's 39.9² = 1592.01. But we need 39.99², which is 1599.\n\nWait, no, 39.9² is 1592.01, which is less than 1599. So, 39.9² = 1592.01, so 40² = 1600.\n\nSo, 1599 is 1599 - 1592.01 = 6.99 above 39.9². So, let's approximate sqrt(1599) as 39.9 + (6.99)/(2*39.9). Using the linear approximation.\n\nSo, delta_x = 6.99, dx = 6.99/(2*39.9) ≈ 6.99/79.8 ≈ 0.0876.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1599) ≈ 39.9 + 0.0876 ≈ 40.0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 39.9 + 0.0876 is 40.0, but 40² is 1600, which is 1 more than 1599. So, that approximation might be a bit off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that 39.9² = 1592.01, so 1599 - 1592.01 = 6.99. So, the square root is 39.9 + 6.99/(2*39.9) ≈ 39.9 + 6.99/79.8 ≈ 39.9 + 0.0876 ≈ 40.0.\n\nBut let me check 39.9 + 0.0876 is 40.0, but 40.0² is 1600, which is 1 more than 1599. So, perhaps actually, sqrt(1599) is approximately 39.9 + 6.99/(2*39.9) ≈ 39.9 + 0.0876 ≈ 40.0. So, sqrt(1599) ≈ 40.0 - 0.0876 ≈ 39.9124.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 39.9² is 1592.01, so 1599 is 6.99 above that, so sqrt(1599) is 39.9 + 6.99/(2*39.9) ≈ 39.9 + 0.0876 ≈ 40.0, but as we saw, 40² is 1600, so actually, sqrt(1599) is just a tiny bit less than 40. So, sqrt(1599) ≈ 39.999.\n\nWait, no, sqrt(1599) is approximately 39.999 because 39.99² is approximately 1599. Let me check 39.99²:\n\n39.99² = (40 - 0.01)² = 1600 - 2*40*0.01 + 0.01² = 1600 - 0.8 + 0.0001 = 1599.2001.\n\nSo, 39.99² = 1599.2001, which is 1599.2001, very close to 1599. So, sqrt(1599) is just slightly less than 39.99, maybe 39.99 - (1599.2001 - 1599)/(2*39.99) by linear approximation.\n\nSo, delta_x = 1599 - 1599.2001 = -0.2001.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1599) ≈ 39.99 + (-0.2001)/(2*39.99) ≈ 39.99 - 0.2001/79.98 ≈ 39.99 - 0.0025 ≈ 39.9875.\n\nSo, sqrt(1599) ≈ 39.9875.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(1599) ≈ 2*39.9875 ≈ 79.975.\n\nSo, B² = 80 + 2*sqrt(1599) ≈ 80 + 79.975 ≈ 159.975.\n\nWait, hold on"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(21) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(28) + sqrt(39). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and express the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, interesting. I think I should start by understanding what each of these square roots is approximately equal to, so I can get a sense of their sizes.\n\nFirst, let me recall that sqrt(25) is 5, and sqrt(21) is just a bit less than 5. Maybe I can approximate sqrt(21). Let me see, 4.5 squared is 20.25, and 4.6 squared is 21.16. So sqrt(21) is somewhere between 4.5 and 4.6. Similarly, sqrt(47) is... well, 6 squared is 36, 7 squared is 49. So sqrt(47) is between 6 and 7. Let me calculate 6.8 squared: 6.8*6.8 is 46.24. So that's close to 47. So sqrt(47) is approximately 6.85. Similarly, sqrt(28) is between 5 and 6. 5.2 squared is 27.04, 5.3 squared is 28.09. So sqrt(28) is approximately 5.29. And sqrt(39) is... let's see, 6 squared is 36, 7 squared is 49. 6.5 squared is 42.25, 6.7 squared is 44.89, 6.9 squared is 47.61, 6.9 squared is 47.61. So sqrt(39) is about 6.245.\n\nSo, let's list these approximations:\n\nsqrt(21) ≈ 4.583\n\nsqrt(47) ≈ 6.854\n\nsqrt(28) ≈ 5.291\n\nsqrt(39) ≈ 6.245\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nsqrt(21) + sqrt(47) ≈ 4.583 + 6.854 ≈ 11.437\n\nsqrt(28) + sqrt(39) ≈ 5.291 + 6.245 ≈ 11.536\n\nSo, based on these approximations, sqrt(28) + sqrt(39) is larger, about 11.536 compared to 11.437. So, sqrt(28) + sqrt(39) is larger.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for a comparison between sqrt(21) + sqrt(47) and sqrt(28) + sqrt(39), which is just a matter of figuring out which one is larger. So, based on the approximations, sqrt(28) + sqrt(39) is larger.\n\nHowever, approximations can sometimes be misleading, especially when dealing with square roots. Maybe I should check if there's a more accurate way to compare them without relying solely on decimal approximations.\n\nI remember that sometimes, when comparing sums of square roots, you can square both sides to eliminate the radicals. That might help. So let me denote A = sqrt(21) + sqrt(47) and B = sqrt(28) + sqrt(39). I need to compare A and B.\n\nSo, to compare A and B, let's square both A and B.\n\nFirst, A squared is:\n\nA² = (sqrt(21) + sqrt(47))² = 21 + 2*sqrt(21*47) + 47 = 21 + 47 + 2*sqrt(987) = 68 + 2*sqrt(987)\n\nSimilarly, B squared is:\n\nB² = (sqrt(28) + sqrt(39))² = 28 + 2*sqrt(28*39) + 39 = 28 + 39 + 2*sqrt(1092) = 67 + 2*sqrt(1092)\n\nSo, now I have A² = 68 + 2*sqrt(987) and B² = 67 + 2*sqrt(1092). To compare A and B, I can compare A² and B².\n\nSo, let's compute the difference between A² and B²:\n\nA² - B² = (68 + 2*sqrt(987)) - (67 + 2*sqrt(1092)) = 1 + 2*(sqrt(987) - sqrt(1092))\n\nSo, A² - B² = 1 + 2*(sqrt(987) - sqrt(1092))\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(987) and sqrt(1092). Hmm, I wonder if I can approximate these or find some relationship.\n\nWait, 987 is less than 1092, so sqrt(987) is less than sqrt(1092). Therefore, sqrt(987) - sqrt(1092) is negative. So, the term 2*(sqrt(987) - sqrt(1092)) is negative. Therefore, A² - B² = 1 + (negative number). So, is 1 minus something positive, whether it's positive or negative?\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(987) and sqrt(1092) more accurately.\n\nLet's compute sqrt(987):\n\nWe know that 31² = 961 and 32² = 1024. So sqrt(987) is between 31 and 32.\n\nCompute 31.4² = 31.4*31.4. Let's compute 31*31 = 961, 0.4*31*2 = 24.8, and 0.4² = 0.16. So total is 961 + 24.8 + 0.16 = 985.96. So, 31.4² = 985.96, which is just slightly less than 987. So, sqrt(987) is approximately 31.4 + (987 - 985.96)/(2*31.4). So, 987 - 985.96 = 1.04, so 1.04/(62.8) ≈ 0.0166. So, sqrt(987) ≈ 31.4 + 0.0166 ≈ 31.4166.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1092):\n\nWe know that 33² = 1089 and 34² = 1156. So sqrt(1092) is between 33 and 34.\n\nCompute 33.0 squared = 1089. 33.1 squared = 33.1*33.1. Let's compute 33*33 = 1089, 0.1*33*2 = 6.6, 0.1² = 0.01. So total is 1089 + 6.6 + 0.01 = 1095.61. But 1092 is less than 1095.61, so let's compute 33.0 squared = 1089, 33.05 squared is?\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to use linear approximation.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = sqrt(x). We know that at x = 1089, f(x) = 33. We want to find f(1092). So, the derivative f’(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(x)). At x = 1089, f’(x) = 1/(2*33) = 1/66 ≈ 0.01515.\n\nSo, using linear approximation: f(1092) ≈ f(1089) + f’(1089)*(1092 - 1089) = 33 + (1/66)*3 ≈ 33 + 0.04545 ≈ 33.04545.\n\nSo, sqrt(1092) ≈ 33.04545.\n\nSo, sqrt(987) ≈ 31.4166 and sqrt(1092) ≈ 33.04545.\n\nSo, sqrt(987) - sqrt(1092) ≈ 31.4166 - 33.04545 ≈ -1.62885"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(23) + sqrt(30) and sqrt(27) + sqrt(28). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(23) + sqrt(30) is larger than sqrt(27) + sqrt(28) or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes when comparing sums of square roots, squaring both expressions can help because it can make the comparison more straightforward. Maybe I can square both sides and see which one is bigger. But before I jump into that, let me write down both expressions clearly.\n\nLet me denote:\nA = sqrt(23) + sqrt(30)\nB = sqrt(27) + sqrt(28)\n\nSo I need to compare A and B. To do this, I can square both A and B and then compare the results. That should give me an idea of which one is larger. Let's start with squaring A.\n\nCalculating A squared:\nA² = (sqrt(23) + sqrt(30))²\n= (sqrt(23))² + 2*sqrt(23)*sqrt(30) + (sqrt(30))²\n= 23 + 2*sqrt(23*30) + 30\n= 53 + 2*sqrt(690)\n\nOkay, so A squared is 53 plus twice the square root of 690. Not too bad yet. Now let me do the same for B squared.\n\nCalculating B squared:\nB² = (sqrt(27) + sqrt(28))²\n= (sqrt(27))² + 2*sqrt(27)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))²\n= 27 + 2*sqrt(27*28) + 28\n= 55 + 2*sqrt(756)\n\nSo now I have A² = 53 + 2*sqrt(690) and B² = 55 + 2*sqrt(756). To compare A and B, I can compare A² and B². If A² > B², then A > B; similarly, if A² < B², then A < B. \n\nLooking at the constants first: 53 vs. 55. So B² has 55, which is 2 more than 53. But that's just the constants. Then, we have the terms with the square roots. Let me calculate both sqrt(690) and sqrt(756).\n\nCalculating sqrt(690):\nI know that 26² is 676 and 27² is 729. So sqrt(690) is between 26 and 27. Let me approximate it. 690 - 676 = 14. So sqrt(690) is approximately 26 + 14/(2*26) = 26 + 14/52 ≈ 26 + 0.269 ≈ 26.269. \n\nCalculating sqrt(756):\nSimilarly, 27² is 729 and 28² is 784. So sqrt(756) is between 27 and 28. Let's see, 756 - 729 = 27. So sqrt(756) is approximately 27 + 27/(2*27) = 27 + 1/2 = 27.5. But actually, let me do a bit better. 27.5² is 756.25, which is very close. So sqrt(756) is approximately 27.5 - a tiny bit. Maybe 27.5 - 0.006, so about 27.494.\n\nSo now, let's plug these approximate values back into A² and B².\n\nCalculating A²:\n53 + 2*26.269 = 53 + 52.538 ≈ 105.538\n\nCalculating B²:\n55 + 2*27.494 = 55 + 54.988 ≈ 110.988\n\nSo A² is approximately 105.538, and B² is approximately 110.988. Since 110.988 > 105.538, that means B² > A², so B > A. Therefore, sqrt(27) + sqrt(28) is larger than sqrt(23) + sqrt(30). \n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The key steps were squaring both expressions, then calculating the numerical values. Let me verify the square roots again.\n\nFor sqrt(690): 26² is 676, 27² is 729, so 690 is 14 above 676. So the square root is 26 + 14/(2*26) = 26 + 0.269 ≈ 26.269. That seems right.\n\nFor sqrt(756): 27² is 729, 28² is 784. So 756 is 27 above 729. Therefore, sqrt(756) ≈ 27 + 27/(2*27) = 27 + 0.5 = 27.5. But since 27.5² is 756.25, which is a bit more than 756, so sqrt(756) is slightly less than 27.5, which is about 27.494. That also seems correct.\n\nSo when we plug these back into A² and B², we get A² ≈ 53 + 2*26.269 ≈ 53 + 52.538 ≈ 105.538, and B² ≈ 55 + 2*27.494 ≈ 55 + 54.988 ≈ 110.988. Since 110.988 is greater than 105.538, B² is indeed larger than A², so B is larger than A.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can consider another approach. Perhaps using the fact that for positive numbers, the function f(x) = sqrt(x) is concave, so by the concavity of sqrt, we can apply Jensen's inequality. Wait, but in this case, we have two terms. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the difference between A² and B². So A² - B² = (53 + 2*sqrt(690)) - (55 + 2*sqrt(756)) = -2 + 2*(sqrt(690) - sqrt(756)). So if sqrt(690) - sqrt(756) is positive, then A² - B² is negative, making B² > A². \n\nBut wait, sqrt(690) is approximately 26.269, and sqrt(756) is approximately 27.494. So sqrt(690) - sqrt(756) ≈ 26.269 - 27.494 ≈ -1.225. Therefore, 2*(sqrt(690) - sqrt(756)) ≈ -2.45. So A² - B² ≈ -2 - 2.45 = -4.45. Therefore, A² - B² ≈ -4.45, which is negative. Hence, B² > A², so B > A.\n\nThis confirms the previous result. Therefore, sqrt(27) + sqrt(28) is larger than sqrt(23) + sqrt(30). \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is by comparing the individual terms. Let me see if I can compare sqrt(27) + sqrt(28) and sqrt(23) + sqrt(30) without squaring. Maybe by estimating the differences.\n\nBut since I already have a numerical approach that gives a clear answer, and the squared method also confirms it, I think it's solid.\n\nWait, just to ensure, maybe I can compute the exact difference in terms of sqrt. Let's see:\n\nA = sqrt(23) + sqrt(30)\nB = sqrt(27) + sqrt(28)\n\nCompute B - A = sqrt(27) + sqrt(28) - sqrt(23) - sqrt(30)\n\nMaybe I can group the terms as (sqrt(27) - sqrt(23)) + (sqrt(28) - sqrt(30)). \n\nI know that sqrt(a) - sqrt(b) can be written as (a - b)/(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)). So let's apply that.\n\nFirst term: sqrt(27) - sqrt(23) = (27 - 23)/(sqrt(27) + sqrt(23)) = 4/(sqrt(27) + sqrt"

Similarly, sqrt(21) is also less than 5 but a bit more than sqrt(19), because 19 is closer to 25 than 21 is. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, 21 is 2 more than 19, but 25 is 4 more. So, since the square function grows faster, sqrt(21) should be a bit more than sqrt(19). Let me write down these approximations:\n\nsqrt(19) ≈ 4.3589\nsqrt(21) ≈ 4.5837\n\nOkay, so sqrt(21) is actually slightly larger than sqrt(19). Similarly, comparing sqrt(45) and sqrt(26):\n\nsqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(45) is a bit more than 6, specifically sqrt(45) ≈ 6.7082.\n\nsqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(26) is a bit more than that, so sqrt(26) ≈ 5.0990.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nsqrt(19) ≈ 4.3589\nsqrt(45) ≈ 6.7082\nTotal ≈ 4.3589 + 6.7082 ≈ 11.0671\n\nsqrt(21) ≈ 4.5837\nsqrt(26) ≈ 5.0990\nTotal ≈ 4.5837 + 5.0990 ≈ 9.6827\n\nSo, adding those, sqrt(19) + sqrt(45) is approximately 11.0671, and sqrt(21) + sqrt(26) is approximately 9.6827. Therefore, sqrt(19) + sqrt(45) is larger.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this without approximating the square roots. Sometimes, comparing expressions can be tricky without exact values.

Let's compute the difference:\n\n64 + 2*sqrt(855) - (47 + 2*sqrt(546)) = (64 - 47) + 2*(sqrt(855) - sqrt(546)) = 17 + 2*(sqrt(855) - sqrt(546))\n\nSo, if I can determine whether sqrt(855) - sqrt(546) is positive or not, I can figure out whether A^2 is greater than B^2.\n\nBut sqrt(855) is sqrt(810 + 45) = sqrt(810 + 45) ≈ 29.24 (since 29^2 = 841, and 29.24^2 ≈ 855). Similarly, sqrt(546) is sqrt(576 - 30) ≈ 23.58 (since 23^2 = 529, and 23.58^2 ≈ 546).\n\nSo, sqrt(855) ≈ 29.24 and sqrt(546) ≈ 23.58.\n\nThus, sqrt(855) - sqrt(546) ≈ 29.24 - 23.58 ≈ 5.66, which is positive.\n\nTherefore, 2*(sqrt(855) - sqrt(546)) ≈ 11.32.\n\nSo, 64 + 2*sqrt(855) - (47 + 2*sqrt(546)) ≈ 17 + 11.32 ≈ 28.32, which is positive.\n\nTherefore, A^2 > B^2, so A > B.\n\nWait, but let me verify if my approximations of sqrt(855) and sqrt(546) are accurate enough. Because if they're not, the difference could be off.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(855) more accurately. 29^2 = 841, as I mentioned. 29.24^2 = ?\n\n29.24^2 = (29 + 0.24)^2 = 29^2 + 2*29*0.24 + 0.24^2 = 841 + 13.92 + 0.0576 = 841 + 13.92 = 854.92 + 0.0576 ≈ 854.9776. So, 29.24^2 ≈ 854.9776, which is just a bit less than 855. So, sqrt(855) is approximately 29.24 + (855 - 854.9776)/(2*29.24) using linear approximation.\n\nCompute the difference: 855 - 854.9776 ≈ 0.0224.\n\nThe derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2*sqrt(x)), so the linear approximation is:\n\nsqrt(855) ≈ sqrt(854.9776) + (0.0224)/(2*29.24)\n≈ 29.24 + 0.0224/(58.48)\n≈ 29.24 + 0.000383 ≈ 29.240383\n\nSo, sqrt(855) ≈ 29.2404.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(546).

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't play nicely with addition. I remember that sometimes you can compare expressions by squaring them if the variables are positive, but since these are square roots, squaring them might simplify things. So maybe I can square both expressions and then compare the results?\n\nLet me write down both expressions:\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(10) + sqrt(45)\nExpression 2: sqrt(16) + sqrt(42)\n\nOkay, so I need to compute (sqrt(10) + sqrt(45))² and (sqrt(16) + sqrt(42))² and see which one is larger.\n\nStarting with Expression 1 squared:\n\n(sqrt(10) + sqrt(45))² = (sqrt(10))² + 2*sqrt(10)*sqrt(45) + (sqrt(45))²\n= 10 + 2*sqrt(450) + 45\n= 55 + 2*sqrt(450)\n\nNow, Expression 2 squared:\n\n(sqrt(16) + sqrt(42))² = (sqrt(16))² + 2*sqrt(16)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))²\n= 16 + 2*sqrt(672) + 42\n= 58 + 2*sqrt(672)\n\nSo now I have:\n\nExpression 1 squared: 55 + 2*sqrt(450)\nExpression 2 squared: 58 + 2*sqrt(672)\n\nAlright, so I can see that Expression 2 squared is larger than Expression 1 squared because 58 > 55. But wait, just because one squared is larger doesn't necessarily mean the original expressions are larger because the square function is monotonically increasing for non-negative numbers. So, if a > b and both a and b are non-negative, then a² > b². Therefore, if Expression 2 squared is larger, Expression 2 must be larger than Expression 1.\n\nBut hold on, let me verify that. I mean, sometimes when you square, you can get a false conclusion if you're not careful. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor Expression 1 squared:\n- (sqrt(10))² is 10\n- (sqrt(45))² is 45\n- 10 + 45 is 55\n- 2*sqrt(10*45) is 2*sqrt(450). Let me compute sqrt(450): sqrt(450) is sqrt(225*2) which is 15*sqrt(2) ≈ 21.213, so 2*21.213 ≈ 42.426\n\nSo, Expression 1 squared ≈ 55 + 42.426 ≈ 97.426\n\nFor Expression 2 squared:\n- (sqrt(16))² is 16\n- (sqrt(42))² is 42\n- 16 + 42 is 58\n- 2*sqrt(16*42) is 2*sqrt(672). Let me compute sqrt(672): sqrt(672) is sqrt(16*42) which is 4*sqrt(42) ≈ 4*6.4807 ≈ 25.923, so 2*25.923 ≈ 51.846\n\nSo, Expression 2 squared ≈ 58 + 51.846 ≈ 109.846\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't add up. 2*sqrt(450) is approximately 42.426, so Expression 1 squared is 55 + 42.426 ≈ 97.426. But 2*sqrt(672) is approximately 51.846, so Expression 2 squared is 58 + 51.846 ≈ 109.846. So, yes, 109.846 is larger than 97.426. Therefore, Expression 2 squared is larger, so Expression 2 is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe the approximation is messing me up. Let me compute sqrt(450) and sqrt(672) more accurately.\n\nsqrt(450): sqrt(450) = sqrt(225*2) = 15*sqrt(2) ≈ 15*1.4142 ≈ 21.213\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(450) ≈ 2*21.213 ≈ 42.426\n\nTherefore, Expression 1 squared ≈ 55 + 42.426 ≈ 97.426\n\nsqrt(672): Let's see, 672 is 16*42, so sqrt(672) = sqrt(16*42) = 4*sqrt(42). sqrt(42) is approximately 6.4807. So, 4*6.4807 ≈ 25.923\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(672) ≈ 2*25.923 ≈ 51.846\n\nHence, Expression 2 squared ≈ 58 + 51.846 ≈ 109.846\n\nSo, 109.846 is indeed larger than 97.426. Therefore, Expression 2 squared is larger than Expression 1 squared, so Expression 2 is larger than Expression 1.\n\nBut wait, hold on, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in computing the sqrt(450) or sqrt(672). Let me compute sqrt(450) more accurately.\n\nsqrt(450): 21^2 is 441, 22^2 is 484. So sqrt(450) is between 21 and 22.\n\nCompute 21.21^2: 21.21*21.21\n\n21*21 = 441\n\n21*0.21 = 4.41\n\n0.21*21 = 4.41\n\n0.21*0.21 = 0.0441\n\nSo, (21 + 0.21)^2 = 21^2 + 2*21*0.21 + 0.21^2 = 441 + 8.82 + 0.0441 ≈ 449.8641\n\nWait, so 21.21^2 is approximately 449.8641, which is just a bit less than 450. So, sqrt(450) is approximately 21.2132.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(672): Let's see, 25^2 is 625, 26^2 is 676. So sqrt(672) is between 25 and 26.\n\nCompute 25.92^2: 25 + 0.92\n\n(25 + 0.92)^2 = 25^2 + 2*25*0.92 + 0.92^2\n\n= 625 + 46 + 0.8464\n\n= 625 + 46 = 671 + 0.8464 ≈ 671.8464\n\nBut 672 is a bit more, so let's try 25.93^2.\n\n25.93^2: 25 + 0.93\n\n= 25^2 + 2*25*0.93 + 0.93^2\n\n= 625 + 46.5 + 0.8649\n\n= 625 + 46.5 = 671.5 + 0.8649 ≈ 672.3649\n\nSo, 25.93^2 ≈ 672.3649, which is slightly more than 672. Therefore, sqrt(672) is slightly less than 25.93, say approximately 25.92.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(672) is approximately 2*25.92 = 51.8"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(6) + sqrt(43) is larger than sqrt(27) + sqrt(38) or vice versa. Hmm, okay. Let me start by writing down both expressions clearly:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(6) + sqrt(43)\nExpression B: sqrt(27) + sqrt(38)\n\nI want to compare these two. Since they involve square roots, maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to handle. Squaring might help me eliminate the square roots and then compare the results more straightforwardly.\n\nLet me recall the formula for squaring a binomial: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So, if I square both Expression A and Expression B, I should be able to compute them and then compare the results.\n\nStarting with Expression A: sqrt(6) + sqrt(43)\n\nSquaring Expression A:\n(sqrt(6) + sqrt(43))^2 = (sqrt(6))^2 + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(43) + (sqrt(43))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(6))^2 = 6\n(sqrt(43))^2 = 43\n\nSo, combining these:\n6 + 43 + 2*sqrt(6*43) = 49 + 2*sqrt(258)\n\nWait, 6*43 is 258? Let me check: 6*40 is 240, plus 6*3 is 18, so 240 + 18 is 258. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Expression A squared is 49 + 2*sqrt(258).\n\nNow, moving on to Expression B: sqrt(27) + sqrt(38)\n\nSquaring Expression B:\n(sqrt(27) + sqrt(38))^2 = (sqrt(27))^2 + 2*sqrt(27)*sqrt(38) + (sqrt(38))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(27))^2 = 27\n(sqrt(38))^2 = 38\n\nAdding these:\n27 + 38 + 2*sqrt(27*38) = 65 + 2*sqrt(966)\n\nWait, 27*38 is 966? Let me verify: 27*30 is 810, and 27*8 is 216, so 810 + 216 = 1026. Wait, that's not 966. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, 27*38. Let me compute it properly. 38 is 30 + 8. So, 27*30 is 810, and 27*8 is 216. So, 810 + 216 is indeed 1026. Hmm, so that's 1026. So, the expression is 65 + 2*sqrt(1026).\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 966, but actually, it's 1026. That's a mistake. So, correction: Expression B squared is 65 + 2*sqrt(1026).\n\nOkay, so now I have squared both expressions:\n\nExpression A squared: 49 + 2*sqrt(258)\nExpression B squared: 65 + 2*sqrt(1026)\n\nNow, I can compare these two squared expressions. Since both 258 and 1026 are under the square roots, and we're adding them to 49 and 65 respectively, I can analyze whether 49 + 2*sqrt(258) is less than or greater than 65 + 2*sqrt(1026).\n\nBut wait, let me think. Since sqrt(1026) is a larger number than sqrt(258), and both are multiplied by 2, the term 2*sqrt(1026) is definitely larger than 2*sqrt(258). However, we also have to consider the constants 49 and 65.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nExpression A squared: 49 + 2*sqrt(258)\nExpression B squared: 65 + 2*sqrt(1026)\n\nSo, 49 is less than 65, but 2*sqrt(1026) is way larger than 2*sqrt(258). So, which effect is stronger? The squared term for Expression A is 49 + something smaller, whereas Expression B is 65 + something larger. So, it's not clear just by the constants.\n\nI think a better approach is to compute the difference between the two squared expressions and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nLet me compute (Expression B squared) - (Expression A squared):\n\n(65 + 2*sqrt(1026)) - (49 + 2*sqrt(258)) = 65 - 49 + 2*sqrt(1026) - 2*sqrt(258) = 16 + 2*(sqrt(1026) - sqrt(258))\n\nSo, the difference is 16 + 2*(sqrt(1026) - sqrt(258)). Since sqrt(1026) is definitely much larger than sqrt(258), the term (sqrt(1026) - sqrt(258)) is positive. Therefore, the entire expression is positive: 16 + 2*(positive number). So, this difference is positive, which means that Expression B squared is greater than Expression A squared.\n\nTherefore, since squaring is a monotonically increasing function for non-negative numbers, if the square of Expression B is greater than the square of Expression A, then Expression B is greater than Expression A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(27) + sqrt(38) is greater than sqrt(6) + sqrt(43).\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when we do multiple steps, mistakes can happen.\n\nFirst, squaring sqrt(6) + sqrt(43):\n\nsqrt(6) = approx 2.449, sqrt(43) = approx 6.557\n\nAdding them: 2.449 + 6.557 ≈ 9.006\n\nSo, sqrt(6) + sqrt(43) ≈ 9.006\n\nNow, squaring that: 9.006^2 ≈ 81.108\n\nNow, let's compute the squared value of Expression A: 6 + 43 + 2*sqrt(258) = 49 + 2*16.062 = 49 + 32.124 = 81.124\n\nSo, 81.124 is pretty close to 81.108. Hmm, that seems a bit off. Wait, why?\n\nWait, sqrt(258): Let's compute sqrt(258). 16^2 is 256, so sqrt(256)=16, so sqrt(258) is just a bit more than 16, like 16.062 as I had before.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(258) is approximately 32.124\n\nAdding to 49: 49 + 32.124 = 81.124\n\nBut earlier, when I computed sqrt(6) + sqrt(43) ≈ 9.006, squaring that gives 81.120, which is very close to 81.124. So, that seems accurate.\n\nNow, let's compute the squared value of Expression B: sqrt(27) + sqrt(38)\n\nsqrt(27) is approx 5.196, sqrt(38) is approx 6.164\n\nAdding them: 5.196 + 6.164 ≈ 11.36\n\nSquaring that: 11.36^2 ≈ 129.0\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately.\n\n11.36 * 11.36:\n\nFirst, 11 * 11 = 121\n\n11 * 0.36 = 3.96\n\n0.36 * 11 = 3.96\n\n0.36 * 0.36 = 0.1296\n\nSo, adding all together:\n\n121 + 3.96 + 3.96 + 0.1296 = 121 + 7.92 + 0.1296 ≈ 121 + 8.0496 ≈ 129.0496\n\nSo, squared value is approximately 129.05.\n\nNow, let's compute squared Expression A: 81.124 (approx). Expression B squared is 129.05"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(7) + sqrt(49). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out which is larger: sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) or sqrt(7) + sqrt(49). Hmm, okay, let me write them down separately to see what we're dealing with.\n\nFirst, sqrt(1) is straightforward. That's just 1. So sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) simplifies to 1 + sqrt(50). On the other hand, sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458, and sqrt(49) is exactly 7 because 7 squared is 49. So, sqrt(7) + sqrt(49) is about 2.6458 + 7, which is 9.6458.\n\nWait, hold on, so sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) would be 1 + sqrt(50). Let me compute sqrt(50) to see how much that is. Since 50 is 25 times 2, sqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2). I know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so 5*1.4142 is 7.071. Therefore, 1 + sqrt(50) is approximately 1 + 7.071, which is 8.071.\n\nComparing that to sqrt(7) + sqrt(49) which is approximately 9.6458, it seems that 9.6458 is larger than 8.071. So, sqrt(7) + sqrt(49) is bigger.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can be misleading. Let's calculate sqrt(50) more precisely. 7^2 is 49, and 7.1^2 is 50.41, which is a bit more than 50, so sqrt(50) is slightly less than 7.1, maybe around 7.071. So, adding 1 to that would give us about 8.071, which still seems less than 9.6458.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare these expressions algebraically rather than numerically because sometimes numerical approximations can be tricky.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(1) + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(7) + sqrt(49). So, A = 1 + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(7) + 7. Let me compute the difference B - A.\n\nSo, B - A = sqrt(7) + 7 - (1 + sqrt(50)) = sqrt(7) + 7 - 1 - sqrt(50) = sqrt(7) + 6 - sqrt(50).\n\nNow, I need to determine whether this difference is positive or negative. If B - A > 0, then B is larger; if it's less than 0, then A is larger.\n\nSo, let's compute sqrt(7) + 6 - sqrt(50). Let me approximate sqrt(7) as 2.6458, sqrt(50) as 7.0710678.\n\nSo, 2.6458 + 6 - 7.0710678 equals (2.6458 + 6) is 8.6458, minus 7.0710678 is approximately 1.5747322.\n\nSo, B - A is approximately 1.5747, which is positive. Therefore, B is larger than A.\n\nWait a second, but 1.5747 is positive, so B is indeed larger. So, sqrt(7) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(50). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(7) + sqrt(49), which can be written as sqrt(7) + sqrt(49).\n\nBut let me think again, maybe I can square both expressions to compare them. Sometimes squaring can help avoid dealing with square roots directly.\n\nLet me compute A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(1) + sqrt(50))^2 = 1 + 2*sqrt(1)*sqrt(50) + 50 = 51 + 2*sqrt(50).\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(49))^2 = 7 + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(49) + 49 = 56 + 2*sqrt(343).\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(50) and sqrt(343):\n\nsqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2) ≈ 7.071.\n\nsqrt(343) is sqrt(7^3) which is 7*sqrt(7) ≈ 18.520.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nA^2 ≈ 51 + 2*7.071 ≈ 51 + 14.142 ≈ 65.142.\n\nB^2 ≈ 56 + 2*18.520 ≈ 56 + 37.040 ≈ 93.040.\n\nSo, B^2 is approximately 93.040, which is much larger than A^2, which is about 65.142. Therefore, B is larger than A.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the squaring step. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, actually, squaring the sum is correct. So, since B^2 is larger, that means B is larger than A. So, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nSo, both methods, one algebraic and one numerical, suggest that sqrt(7) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(50). Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(7) + sqrt(49).\n\nBut let me just think once more to make sure I haven't missed anything. Is there a way to compare these expressions without expanding?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the difference in terms of inequalities.\n\nWe have A = 1 + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(7) + sqrt(49).\n\nSo, let me define C = sqrt(7) and D = sqrt(49). Then, B = C + D.\n\nSimilarly, A = 1 + D, since D = sqrt(49) is 7.\n\nTherefore, A = 1 + D and B = C + D.\n\nSo, comparing A and B is the same as comparing 1 + D and C + D.\n\nWhich is the same as comparing 1 and C, since D is common in both.\n\nSo, since 1 < C because C is sqrt(7) which is approximately 2.6458, so 1 < 2.6458, so A = 1 + D < C + D = B.\n\nTherefore, B is larger.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(7) + sqrt(49). So, in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), that would be sqrt(7) + sqrt(49).\n\nBut wait, sqrt(49) is just 7, so maybe the question expects a different form? But no, it just says write the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, 7 is a square number, so sqrt(49) is 7. So, yes, sqrt(7) + sqrt(49) is the correct form.\n\nAlternatively, if the question expects a different combination, but in this case, that's the only way to express it.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that sqrt(7) + sqrt(49) is the larger one.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute both A and B with more precise decimal places.\n\nCompute A: sqrt(1) = 1, sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071067811865475.\n\nSo, A ≈ 1 + 7.071067811865475 ≈ 8.071067811865475.\n\nCompute B: sqrt(7) ≈ 2.6457513110645906, sqrt(49) = 7.\n\nSo, B ≈ 2.6457513110645906 + 7 ≈ 9.645751311064591.\n\nSo, A ≈ 8.071067811865475, B ≈ 9.645751311064591.\n\nSo, clearly, B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(7) + sqrt(49) is larger.\n\nSo, the answer is sqrt(7) + sqrt(49).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, is sqrt(49) equal to 7? Yes, by definition. So, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the question was expecting a different form, but I don't think so.\n\nTherefore"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare two sums of square roots: sqrt(1) + sqrt(31) and sqrt(23) + sqrt(25). The goal is to figure out which one is larger and express the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I know that square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't play nice with addition like regular numbers do. So, I can't just add the square roots directly and compare them as is. Instead, maybe I should try squaring both expressions to make it easier to compare. That way, I can work with simpler numbers without losing the information I need to determine which is larger.\n\nLet me write down both expressions:\n1. sqrt(1) + sqrt(31)\n2. sqrt(23) + sqrt(25)\n\nSo, if I let A = sqrt(1) + sqrt(31) and B = sqrt(23) + sqrt(25), I need to find which one is larger: A or B. To compare A and B, I can square both and see which square is larger. \n\nStarting with A:\nA = sqrt(1) + sqrt(31)\nSo, A squared is (sqrt(1) + sqrt(31))². Let me expand that:\nA² = (sqrt(1))² + 2*sqrt(1)*sqrt(31) + (sqrt(31))²\nSimplifying each term:\nA² = 1 + 2*sqrt(31) + 31\nCombine like terms:\nA² = 1 + 31 + 2*sqrt(31) = 32 + 2*sqrt(31)\n\nNow, moving on to B:\nB = sqrt(23) + sqrt(25)\nSo, B squared is (sqrt(23) + sqrt(25))². Expanding this:\nB² = (sqrt(23))² + 2*sqrt(23)*sqrt(25) + (sqrt(25))²\nSimplify each term:\nB² = 23 + 2*sqrt(575) + 25\nCombine like terms:\nB² = 23 + 25 + 2*sqrt(575) = 48 + 2*sqrt(575)\n\nNow, we have A² = 32 + 2*sqrt(31) and B² = 48 + 2*sqrt(575). To determine which is larger, we can compare A² and B². Since both are in the form of a constant plus twice a square root, we can subtract 2 from both to make it simpler, but I think it might not be necessary. Alternatively, compare 32 + 2*sqrt(31) and 48 + 2*sqrt(575). \n\nLet me compute the numerical values to see which one is larger. I know that sqrt(31) is approximately 5.56776, and sqrt(575) is approximately 23.97913. So, plugging these in:\n\nA² ≈ 32 + 2*5.56776 ≈ 32 + 11.13552 ≈ 43.13552\n\nB² ≈ 48 + 2*23.97913 ≈ 48 + 47.95826 ≈ 95.95826\n\nWait a second, that can't be right. If A² is approximately 43.13552 and B² is approximately 95.95826, then clearly B² is larger than A². Therefore, B must be larger than A. So, the expression sqrt(23) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(31). \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. I know that sqrt(575) is approximately 23.97913 because 23 squared is 529 and 24 squared is 576, so sqrt(575) is just a bit less than 24, which is about 23.97913. So, 2*sqrt(575) is approximately 47.95826, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(31) is about 5.56776, so 2*sqrt(31) is approximately 11.13552, and adding that to 32 gives 43.13552. On the other hand, sqrt(23) is approximately 4.79583, so 2*sqrt(23) is approximately 9.59166, adding that to 48 gives 57.59166, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, hold on, 23 + 25 is 48, and sqrt(23) + sqrt(25) is 4.79583 + 5 = 9.79583, and then multiplied by 2? Wait, no, no. Wait, no, I think I made a confusion here.\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up when I thought B squared was 48 + 2*sqrt(575). But actually, sqrt(23) is approximately 4.79583, so 2*sqrt(23) is approximately 9.59166, and sqrt(25) is 5, so 2*sqrt(25) is 10. Therefore, B squared is (sqrt(23) + sqrt(25))² = 23 + 2*sqrt(23)*sqrt(25) + 25. So, 23 + 25 is 48, and 2*sqrt(23)*sqrt(25) is 2*sqrt(575). So that is 48 + 2*sqrt(575). So, 2*sqrt(575) is approximately 2*23.97913≈47.95826, so adding that to 48 gives 95.95826. On the other hand, A squared is (sqrt(1) + sqrt(31))² = 1 + 2*sqrt(31) + 31 = 32 + 2*sqrt(31). 2*sqrt(31) is approximately 11.13552, so 32 + 11.13552≈43.13552. \n\nTherefore, B squared is about 95.95826, which is greater than A squared, 43.13552. Therefore, B is greater than A. Therefore, sqrt(23) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(31). So, the answer is sqrt(23) + sqrt(25). \n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's another way to think about it without squaring. Maybe using the triangle inequality or something? Hmm, the triangle inequality says that for positive numbers, the sum of square roots is less than the square root of the sum of squares, but that might not apply here since we're adding two different square roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approximate the values numerically without squaring. Let's try that.\n\nCompute sqrt(1) + sqrt(31):\nsqrt(1) = 1\nsqrt(31) ≈ 5.56776\nSo, 1 + 5.56776 ≈ 6.56776\n\nCompute sqrt(23) + sqrt(25):\nsqrt(23) ≈ 4.79583\nsqrt(25) = 5\nSo, 4.79583 + 5 ≈ 9.79583\n\nComparing the two, 9.79583 is clearly larger than 6.56776. So, again, sqrt(23) + sqrt(25) is larger. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the differences. Let's compute the difference between B and A:\n\nB - A = (sqrt(23) + sqrt(25)) - (sqrt(1) + sqrt(31)) ≈ (4.79583 + 5) - (1 + 5.56776) ≈ 9.79583 - 6.56776 ≈ 3.22807\n\nSo, B is approximately 3.22807 larger than A. Therefore, B is definitely larger.\n\nHmm, seems pretty solid. So, I think I can confidently say that sqrt(23) + sqrt(25) is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(31). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(23) + sqrt(25"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which is larger between sqrt(11) + sqrt(45) and sqrt(22) + sqrt(28). Hmm, I remember that sometimes when you have square roots added together, you can compare them by squaring both expressions. That might make it easier to see which one is bigger. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me denote A = sqrt(11) + sqrt(45) and B = sqrt(22) + sqrt(28). I need to compare A and B. To do this, I'll square both A and B and see which result is larger. If A squared is larger than B squared, then A is larger than B, and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's compute A squared first:\n\nA² = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(45))²\n    = (sqrt(11))² + 2*sqrt(11)*sqrt(45) + (sqrt(45))²\n    = 11 + 2*sqrt(11*45) + 45\n    = 11 + 45 + 2*sqrt(495)\n    = 56 + 2*sqrt(495)\n\nAlright, now let's compute B squared:\n\nB² = (sqrt(22) + sqrt(28))²\n    = (sqrt(22))² + 2*sqrt(22)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))²\n    = 22 + 2*sqrt(22*28) + 28\n    = 22 + 28 + 2*sqrt(616)\n    = 50 + 2*sqrt(616)\n\nSo now I have A² = 56 + 2*sqrt(495) and B² = 50 + 2*sqrt(616). I need to compare these two.\n\nBut wait, 56 is greater than 50, so 56 + 2*sqrt(495) vs 50 + 2*sqrt(616). Since 56 > 50, but the other terms might make it not clear. Maybe I should subtract the smaller part from both to see the difference.\n\nLet's compute (A² - B²):\n\nA² - B² = (56 + 2*sqrt(495)) - (50 + 2*sqrt(616))\n        = 6 + 2*(sqrt(495) - sqrt(616))\n\nHmm, sqrt(495) is sqrt(9*55) = 3*sqrt(55), and sqrt(616) is sqrt(16*38.5) which is 4*sqrt(15.125). Wait, maybe I can find exact values or approximate them to see which is bigger.\n\nBut before that, let me think if I can compare sqrt(495) and sqrt(616) directly. Since 495 < 616, sqrt(495) < sqrt(616). Therefore, sqrt(495) - sqrt(616) is negative. So, when I multiply by 2, it's still negative. Then, adding 6 to that negative number.\n\nSo, is 6 + 2*(negative) positive or negative? Well, 2*(sqrt(495) - sqrt(616)) is negative, so 6 + negative number. Whether it's positive or negative depends on the magnitude of 2*(sqrt(495) - sqrt(616)) compared to 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the approximate values of sqrt(495) and sqrt(616).\n\nLet me approximate sqrt(495):\n\nWe know that 22² = 484 and 23² = 529. So sqrt(495) is between 22 and 23.\n\nLet me see: 22.25² = (22 + 0.25)² = 22² + 2*22*0.25 + 0.25² = 484 + 11 + 0.0625 = 495.0625. Oh, that's very close to 495.\n\nSo sqrt(495) ≈ 22.25 - a little bit. Since 495.0625 is 0.0625 more than 495, so sqrt(495) ≈ 22.25 - 0.0625/(2*22.25) ≈ 22.25 - 0.0625/44.5 ≈ 22.25 - 0.0014 ≈ 22.2486.\n\nSo sqrt(495) ≈ 22.2486.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(616):\n\nWe know that 24² = 576, 25² = 625. So sqrt(616) is just a bit less than 25.\n\nLet me compute 24.8²:\n\n24 + 0.8 squared = 24² + 2*24*0.8 + 0.8² = 576 + 38.4 + 0.64 = 615.04\n\nThat's pretty close to 616. So, sqrt(616) ≈ 24.8 + (616 - 615.04)/(2*24.8)\n\nWhich is approximately 24.8 + 0.96 / 49.6 ≈ 24.8 + 0.0193 ≈ 24.8193.\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the right way. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since 24.8² = 615.04, which is 0.96 less than 616. So, the difference is 616 - 615.04 = 0.96. So, the next term in the linear approximation is (0.96)/(2*24.8) ≈ 0.96 / 49.6 ≈ 0.0193. So, sqrt(616) ≈ 24.8 + 0.0193 ≈ 24.8193.\n\nBut wait, actually, that might not be the correct way because the function sqrt(x) is concave, so the linear approximation might not be accurate. Maybe using a better method.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate sqrt(616). Let me take an initial guess of 24.8 as before.\n\nCompute f(x) = x² - 616, f'(x) = 2x.\n\nStarting iteration:\n\nx0 = 24.8\n\nf(x0) = 24.8² - 616 = 615.04 - 616 = -0.96\n\nf'(x0) = 2*24.8 = 49.6\n\nNext iteration:\n\nx1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 24.8 - (-0.96)/49.6 ≈ 24.8 + 0.0193 ≈ 24.8193\n\nCompute f(x1) = (24.8193)² - 616\n\n24.8193 squared: Let's compute it as (24 + 0.8193)² = 24² + 2*24*0.8193 + 0.8193² = 576 + 39.3984 + 0.671 ≈ 576 + 39.3984 = 615.3984 + 0.671 ≈ 616.0694\n\nSo, f(x1) ≈ 616.0694 - 616 = 0.0694\n\nSo, f(x1) ≈ 0.0694, which is positive.\n\nCompute f'(x1) = 2*24.8193 ≈ 49.6386\n\nNext iteration:\n\nx2 = x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1) ≈ 24.8193 - 0.0694 / 49.6386 ≈ 24.8193 - 0.0014 ≈ 24.8179\n\nCompute f(x2) = (24.8179)² - 616\n\nAgain, compute 24.8179 squared:\n\n24 + 0.8179 squared = 24² + 2*24*0.8179 + 0.8"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two sums of square roots: sqrt(16) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(32). Then, I need to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't behave linearly. Just because one number is bigger doesn't automatically mean its square root is bigger. So, I can't just say sqrt(43) is bigger than sqrt(32) because 43 is bigger than 32. But wait, actually, both of these square roots are being added to other square roots, so maybe the overall sum is the same or different.\n\nLet me write down the two expressions:\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(16) + sqrt(43)\nExpression 2: sqrt(18) + sqrt(32)\n\nI need to find out whether Expression 1 is greater than Expression 2 or vice versa.\n\nTo compare sqrt(16) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(32), I can compute both values numerically and see which is larger. Alternatively, I can square both expressions to eliminate the square roots and see which squared value is larger. Squaring might be a good approach because it preserves the inequality if both expressions are positive, which they are here.\n\nLet me try squaring both expressions.\n\nFirst, for Expression 1:\n(sqrt(16) + sqrt(43))² = (sqrt(16))² + 2*sqrt(16)*sqrt(43) + (sqrt(43))²\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(16))² = 16\n2*sqrt(16)*sqrt(43) = 2*4*sqrt(43) = 8*sqrt(43)\n(sqrt(43))² = 43\nSo, adding them up:\n16 + 43 + 8*sqrt(43) = 59 + 8*sqrt(43)\n\nSimilarly, for Expression 2:\n(sqrt(18) + sqrt(32))² = (sqrt(18))² + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(32) + (sqrt(32))²\nCalculating each term:\n(sqrt(18))² = 18\n2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(32) = 2*sqrt(18*32) = 2*sqrt(576) = 2*24 = 48\n(sqrt(32))² = 32\nAdding them up:\n18 + 32 + 48 = 98\n\nSo, now I have:\n\nExpression 1 squared: 59 + 8*sqrt(43)\nExpression 2 squared: 98\n\nTo compare Expression 1 and Expression 2, I can compare their squares. Since both expressions are positive, their squares will preserve the inequality.\n\nSo, let's compute 59 + 8*sqrt(43) and see if it's greater than 98 or not.\n\nFirst, let's find sqrt(43). I know that 6²=36 and 7²=49, so sqrt(43) is between 6 and 7. Let me approximate it.\n\nLet me compute 6.5² = 42.25, which is less than 43. Then, 6.6² = 43.56, which is more than 43. So sqrt(43) is between 6.5 and 6.6.\n\nLet me get a better approximation. Let's try 6.5 + x, where x is the fractional part.\n\n(6.5 + x)² = 42.25 + 13x + x² = 43\n\nSo, 13x + x² = 0.75\n\nAssuming x is small, x² is negligible, so 13x ≈ 0.75 => x ≈ 0.75/13 ≈ 0.0577\n\nSo, sqrt(43) ≈ 6.5 + 0.0577 ≈ 6.5577\n\nLet's compute 8*sqrt(43) ≈ 8*6.5577 ≈ 52.4616\n\nSo, Expression 1 squared ≈ 59 + 52.4616 ≈ 111.4616\n\nExpression 2 squared is 98.\n\nSo, 111.4616 > 98, which means Expression 1 squared is greater than Expression 2 squared. Therefore, Expression 1 is greater than Expression 2.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(16) + sqrt(43) is larger than sqrt(18) + sqrt(32).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my approximations because sometimes approximating can lead to errors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute sqrt(43) more precisely.\n\nLet me see:\n\n6.55² = 6.55*6.55\n\n6*6=36, 6*0.55=3.3, 0.55*6=3.3, 0.55*0.55=0.3025\n\nAdding up: 36 + 3.3 + 3.3 + 0.3025 = 36 + 6.6 + 0.3025 = 42.9025\n\nSo, 6.55² = 42.9025\n\nWe need 43, so 43 - 42.9025 = 0.0975\n\nSo, the next step is to use linear approximation.\n\nLet f(x) = x², f'(x) = 2x.\n\nWe have f(6.55) = 42.9025\n\nWe need to find x such that f(x) = 43\n\nSo, x = 6.55 + delta\n\n2*6.55*delta ≈ 0.0975\n\n13.1*delta ≈ 0.0975\n\ndelta ≈ 0.0975 / 13.1 ≈ 0.00743\n\nSo, sqrt(43) ≈ 6.55 + 0.00743 ≈ 6.55743\n\nTherefore, 8*sqrt(43) ≈ 8*6.55743 ≈ 52.45944\n\nThus, Expression 1 squared ≈ 59 + 52.45944 ≈ 111.45944\n\nWhich is still greater than 98.\n\nSo, my initial approximation was correct.\n\nTherefore, Expression 1 is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method to compare the two sums without squaring.\n\nI know that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) is a function that increases with a and b, but the rate of increase is not linear.\n\nBut in this case, since both expressions have two square roots being added, maybe it's tricky to directly compare.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the difference between the two sums.\n\nLet me compute Expression 1 - Expression 2:\n\n[sqrt(16) + sqrt(43)] - [sqrt(18) + sqrt(32)] = sqrt(16) - sqrt(18) + sqrt(43) - sqrt(32)\n\nWe can compute each term:\n\nsqrt(16) = 4\n\nsqrt(18) = 3*sqrt(2) ≈ 4.2426\n\nsqrt(43) ≈ 6.5574\n\nsqrt(32) = 4*sqrt(2) ≈ 5.6568\n\nSo, the difference:\n\n4 - 4.2426 + 6.5574 - 5.6568\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n4 - 4.2426 ≈ -0.2426\n\n6.5574 - 5.6568 ≈ 0.9006\n\nSo, total difference ≈ (-0.2426) + 0.9006 ≈ 0.658\n\nSo, Expression 1 is approximately 0.658 larger than Expression 2.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(16) + sqrt(43) is larger.\n\nBut to confirm, let me compute the exact difference.\n\nExpression 1: 4 + sqrt(43)\n\nExpression 2: sqrt(18) + sqrt(32) = 3*sqrt(2) + 4*sqrt(2) = 7*sqrt(2)\n\nWait, hold on, sqrt(18) is 3*sqrt(2), and sqrt(32) is 4*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(18) + sqrt(32) = 7*sqrt(2)\n\nSo, Expression 2 is 7*sqrt(2)\n\nExpression"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two sums: sqrt(16) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(18) + sqrt(41). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate each of these square roots individually to see what they add up to. That should make it easier to compare them. Let's start with sqrt(16). I know that 4 times 4 is 16, so sqrt(16) must be 4. That part was straightforward.\n\nNext, sqrt(49). Hmm, 7 times 7 is 49, so that means sqrt(49) is 7. So, when I add those two together, sqrt(16) + sqrt(49) is 4 + 7, which is 11. Okay, so the first sum is 11.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second sum: sqrt(18) + sqrt(41). I don't remember the exact square roots for these, but I can approximate them or maybe find exact forms if possible. Let me think.\n\nStarting with sqrt(18). I know that 18 is between 16 and 25, so sqrt(18) should be between 4 and 5. Maybe I can find a better approximation. Let's see, 4.2 squared is 17.64, which is pretty close to 18. So, sqrt(18) is approximately 4.2426. I remember that 4.2426 squared is 18, so we can use that for calculation.\n\nNow, moving on to sqrt(41). Hmm, 41 is just a bit more than 36, which is 6 squared, and 49 is 7 squared. So, sqrt(41) is between 6 and 7. Let me calculate it more accurately. 6.4 squared is 40.96, which is just a tiny bit less than 41. So, sqrt(41) is approximately 6.4031. That's pretty close.\n\nSo, adding sqrt(18) and sqrt(41) together: 4.2426 + 6.4031. Let me add those numbers. 4 + 6 is 10, 0.2426 + 0.4031 is 0.6457. So, total is approximately 10.6457. Hmm, so the second sum is about 10.6457, while the first sum was 11. So, 11 is larger than 10.6457.\n\nWait, but I should check if my approximations were accurate enough. Maybe I can think of another way to compare these sums without using decimal approximations. Perhaps by manipulating the expressions algebraically?\n\nLet me recall that if I have two sums of square roots, I can sometimes compare them by squaring both sides. Although, I have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions or complicate things, but in this case, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(16) + sqrt(49) = 4 + 7 = 11, as I already found.\n\nAnd B = sqrt(18) + sqrt(41). I need to compare A and B. Let me compute A squared and B squared, since A and B are both positive, squaring won't ruin the inequality relationship.\n\nSo, A squared is (4 + 7)^2. Wait, that's 11 squared, which is 121. Okay, so A squared is 121.\n\nNow, B squared is (sqrt(18) + sqrt(41))^2. Let's expand that. It's equal to (sqrt(18))^2 + 2*sqrt(18)*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))^2.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(18))^2 is 18.\n\n(sqrt(41))^2 is 41.\n\nAnd the middle term is 2*sqrt(18*41). Hmm, let me compute 18*41 first. 18 times 40 is 720, plus 18 is 738. So, 18*41 is 738. Therefore, sqrt(738) is involved.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(738). Let me compute sqrt(738). Hmm, 27 squared is 729, which is just 9 less than 738. So, sqrt(738) is approximately 27.166. Because 27.166 squared is approximately 738. Let me check that: 27 squared is 729, 0.166 squared is about 0.0276, and cross terms are 2*27*0.166 = 9. So, 729 + 9 + 0.0276 is 738.0276, which is pretty close. So, sqrt(738) is approximately 27.166, so 2*sqrt(738) is approximately 54.332.\n\nSo, putting it all together, B squared is 18 + 54.332 + 41. Let's add those up. 18 + 41 is 59, plus 54.332 is 113.332. So, B squared is approximately 113.332.\n\nOn the other hand, A squared was 121. So, A squared is larger than B squared. Therefore, since both A and B are positive numbers, A must be greater than B. So, sqrt(16) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(18) + sqrt(41).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me see if this approximation method is reliable. I approximated sqrt(18) as 4.2426 and sqrt(41) as 6.4031, which gave me a total of approximately 10.6457, which is less than 11, which is A. Then, when I squared both, A squared was 121, and B squared was approximately 113.332. Since 121 is greater than 113.332, that indeed suggests A is greater than B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of another way to compare the sums. Perhaps by squaring each term and summing them. Wait, that's similar to what I did before, but perhaps I can think of it differently.\n\nLet me consider the difference between A and B. A is 11, B is approximately 10.6457, so the difference is about 0.3543. So, A is larger by that amount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as comparing the two sums without calculating their decimal values. For example, sqrt(16) is 4, so 4 is a term. Then sqrt(49) is 7. So, 4 + 7 is 11.\n\nOn the other hand, sqrt(18) is less than sqrt(25) which is 5, so sqrt(18) is less than 5. Similarly, sqrt(41) is less than sqrt(49) which is 7, so sqrt(41) is less than 7. So, sqrt(18) + sqrt(41) is less than 5 + 7, which is 12. But that's a weaker statement than the previous one.\n\nWait, but 5 + 7 is 12, which is bigger than 11, so that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare term by term. So, sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(49) is 7, which sums to 11. Then sqrt(18) is less than sqrt(25) which is 5, so 4 + something less than 5 is less than 11. Similarly, sqrt(41) is less than sqrt(49) which is 7, so 4 + something less than 7 is less than 11.\n\nTherefore, both terms in B are less than the terms in A, but in different ways. So, maybe A is larger because even though each term in B is less than the corresponding term in A, their combined effect is still larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality, but I think that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact difference. Let me try that.\n\nCompute A - B. So, 11 - (sqrt(18) + sqrt(41)). I need to see if this is positive or negative.\n\nBut to compute this difference, I might need exact values or some way to compare without decimal approximations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square the difference, but that might get complicated.\n\nWait, let's think of it another way. Suppose I have two sums: one is "

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(25) + sqrt(45) and sqrt(26) + sqrt(32). The question is asking which one is larger, and then I have to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(25) is 5 because 5 squared is 25. So, sqrt(25) is straightforward. Then, sqrt(45) is a bit trickier. I remember that sqrt(45) can be simplified because 45 is 9 times 5. So, sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) which is sqrt(9)*sqrt(5) = 3*sqrt(5). So, sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5). That means sqrt(25) + sqrt(45) is 5 + 3*sqrt(5). Okay, got that.\n\nNow, let's look at the other expression: sqrt(26) + sqrt(32). Hmm, okay, 26 is a prime number, so I can't simplify sqrt(26) any further. Similarly, 32 is 16 times 2, so sqrt(32) can be simplified as sqrt(16*2) which is sqrt(16)*sqrt(2) = 4*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(32) is 4*sqrt(2). Therefore, sqrt(26) + sqrt(32) is sqrt(26) + 4*sqrt(2). Hmm, so now we have both expressions in terms of sqrt terms.\n\nSo, to compare 5 + 3*sqrt(5) and sqrt(26) + 4*sqrt(2), I need to figure out which one is bigger. Maybe I can compute the numerical values of both expressions and then compare them?\n\nLet me try that. First, compute 5 + 3*sqrt(5). I know sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236. So, 3*sqrt(5) is 3*2.236 which is 6.708. Then, adding 5 to that gives me 11.708. So, sqrt(25) + sqrt(45) is approximately 11.708.\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(26) + 4*sqrt(2). Let's see, sqrt(26) is approximately 5.099 because 5.1 squared is 26.01, which is pretty close. So, sqrt(26) ≈ 5.099. Then, 4*sqrt(2) is 4*1.414 which is 5.656. Adding those together, 5.099 + 5.656 is approximately 10.755. So, sqrt(26) + sqrt(32) is approximately 10.755.\n\nComparing the two results, 11.708 vs. 10.755. Clearly, 11.708 is larger. So, sqrt(25) + sqrt(45) is larger than sqrt(26) + sqrt(32).\n\nBut wait, the question is asking me to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, in this case, the larger number is 5 + 3*sqrt(5), which is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) if I write it as sqrt(25) + sqrt(45). But maybe they want a different representation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about whether sqrt(25) + sqrt(45) can be combined or if there's another way to express it. But since 25 and 45 are both perfect squares or can be factored into squares, maybe it's the simplest form. Alternatively, if I want to write it as a single square root, that might not be possible because addition doesn't translate directly to multiplication under the square root.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have sqrt(25) + sqrt(45), that's 5 + 3*sqrt(5). Maybe I can factor out a 5? But that would give 5*(1 + (3/5)*sqrt(5)), which doesn't seem particularly helpful. Alternatively, is there a way to express 5 + 3*sqrt(5) as another sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)?\n\nHmm, perhaps. Let me consider that 5 + 3*sqrt(5) can be written as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). If I can find a and b such that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) equals 5 + 3*sqrt(5). Let me set up the equations:\n\nsqrt(a) + sqrt(b) = 5 + 3*sqrt(5)\n\nIf I square both sides, I get:\n\n(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))^2 = (5 + 3*sqrt(5))^2\n\nWhich is:\n\na + 2*sqrt(a*b) + b = 25 + 2*5*3*sqrt(5) + 9*5\n\nCalculating the right side:\n\n25 + 30*sqrt(5) + 45 = 70 + 30*sqrt(5)\n\nSo, the left side is:\n\na + b + 2*sqrt(a*b) = 70 + 30*sqrt(5)\n\nTherefore, we can equate the rational and irrational parts:\n\na + b = 70\n\n2*sqrt(a*b) = 30*sqrt(5)\n\nSimplify the second equation:\n\nsqrt(a*b) = 15*sqrt(5)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na*b = 225*5 = 1125\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\na + b = 70\n\na*b = 1125\n\nSo, we need to find two numbers a and b such that their sum is 70 and their product is 1125. Let's solve this system.\n\nLet me let’s set up the quadratic equation. If a and b are roots of x^2 - (a + b)x + a*b = 0, then:\n\nx^2 - 70x + 1125 = 0\n\nLet me try to factor this or solve it using quadratic formula.\n\nQuadratic formula: x = [70 ± sqrt(70^2 - 4*1*1125)] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n70^2 = 4900\n\n4*1*1125 = 4500\n\nSo discriminant is 4900 - 4500 = 400\n\nsqrt(400) = 20\n\nThus, x = [70 ± 20]/2\n\nSo, x = (70 + 20)/2 = 90/2 = 45\n\nOr x = (70 - 20)/2 = 50/2 = 25\n\nSo, a and b are 45 and 25.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) = sqrt(45) + sqrt(25) = 3*sqrt(5) + 5, which is the same as before. So, that confirms that 5 + 3*sqrt(5) can be written as sqrt(25) + sqrt(45). But that's the same expression we started with. So, maybe it's not necessary to write it differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to recognize that sqrt(25) + sqrt(45) is larger without necessarily expressing it as another sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). But since the problem says \"write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)\", so I have to do that.\n\nTherefore, since 5 + 3*sqrt(5) is already in the form sqrt(25) + sqrt(45), I can write that as the answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, because sometimes when you have multiple forms, it's possible that another combination might give a different result. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate both expressions more accurately.\n\nEarlier, I approximated sqrt(26) + sqrt(32) as approximately 10.755 and sqrt(25) + sqrt(45) as approximately 11.708. Let's confirm these approximations.\n\nCalculating sqrt(26):\n\n5.0990195135927845 because 5.099^2 = 26.000 roughly. So, sqrt(26) ≈ 5.099.\n\nsqrt(32):\n\n5.656854249492381 because 5.656^2 = 32. So, sqrt(32) ≈ 5.656.\n\nAdding 5.099 + 5.656 ≈ 10.755.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(25) + sqrt(45):\n\nsqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(45) is approximately 6.70820393258"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(6) + sqrt(19) and sqrt(7) + sqrt(15). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(6) + sqrt(19) and sqrt(7) + sqrt(15). I need to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, where do I start?\n\nI remember that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both expressions can help because it can make the comparison more straightforward. Since both expressions are sums of square roots, squaring them might eliminate the square roots and let me just compare polynomials instead. That seems like a solid approach.\n\nLet me denote the first expression as A = sqrt(6) + sqrt(19) and the second as B = sqrt(7) + sqrt(15). I need to compare A and B. So, if I square both A and B, I can see which one is larger.\n\nStarting with A squared: (sqrt(6) + sqrt(19))². I know that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so applying that here:\n\nA² = (sqrt(6))² + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(19) + (sqrt(19))²\n     = 6 + 2*sqrt(6*19) + 19\n     = 6 + 2*sqrt(114) + 19\n     = 25 + 2*sqrt(114)\n\nNow, let me do the same for B squared: (sqrt(7) + sqrt(15))².\n\nB² = (sqrt(7))² + 2*sqrt(7)*sqrt(15) + (sqrt(15))²\n     = 7 + 2*sqrt(7*15) + 15\n     = 7 + 2*sqrt(105) + 15\n     = 22 + 2*sqrt(105)\n\nAlright, so now I have A² = 25 + 2*sqrt(114) and B² = 22 + 2*sqrt(105). To compare A and B, I need to compare A² and B² because since both A and B are positive numbers, the larger one squared will be the larger one.\n\nSo, let's look at the difference between A² and B²:\n\nA² - B² = (25 + 2*sqrt(114)) - (22 + 2*sqrt(105))\n          = 25 - 22 + 2*sqrt(114) - 2*sqrt(105)\n          = 3 + 2*(sqrt(114) - sqrt(105))\n\nHmm, so I have 3 + 2*(sqrt(114) - sqrt(105)). I need to figure out whether this is positive or negative because if it is positive, then A² > B², meaning A > B, and vice versa.\n\nSo, the question boils down to whether sqrt(114) - sqrt(105) is positive or negative, and then multiplying by 2 and adding 3. Since sqrt(114) is definitely larger than sqrt(105) because 114 is larger than 105, their difference is positive.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(114) and sqrt(105) approximately to see the magnitude.\n\nCalculating sqrt(114):\n\nI know that 10² = 100 and 11² = 121, so sqrt(114) is between 10 and 11.\n\nCalculating 10.6² = 112.36, which is less than 114.\n\n10.7² = 114.49, which is just over 114. So sqrt(114) is approximately 10.68.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(105):\n\n10² = 100, 10.2² = 104.04, 10.25² = 105.0625. So sqrt(105) is approximately 10.25.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(114) ≈ 10.68 and sqrt(105) ≈ 10.25.\n\nSo sqrt(114) - sqrt(105) ≈ 10.68 - 10.25 ≈ 0.43.\n\nMultiply that by 2: 0.43 * 2 ≈ 0.86.\n\nAdd 3: 3 + 0.86 ≈ 3.86.\n\nSo, A² - B² ≈ 3.86, which is positive. Therefore, A² > B², which implies A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(6) + sqrt(19) is greater than sqrt(7) + sqrt(15). So, the larger number is sqrt(6) + sqrt(19), which is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, I just need to write that as the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I did everything correctly. Sometimes approximations can be misleading, so maybe I should check more precisely or see if there's another way to compare them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the exact difference without approximating, but that might be more complicated. Let me think about another approach.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps I can subtract B from A and see if the result is positive or not. But that's essentially the same as squaring, so I think the previous approach is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using some algebraic manipulation or inequality properties.\n\nWait, I remember that for positive numbers, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) can be compared by squaring, so that's exactly what I did. So unless I made a calculation error in squaring, which I don't think I did, because when I squared A and B, I correctly expanded the terms.\n\nWait, let me double-check the squaring:\n\nFor A: (sqrt(6) + sqrt(19))² = 6 + 2*sqrt(6*19) + 19 = 25 + 2*sqrt(114). Correct.\n\nFor B: (sqrt(7) + sqrt(15))² = 7 + 2*sqrt(7*15) + 15 = 22 + 2*sqrt(105). Correct.\n\nSo, that part is right.\n\nThen, A² - B² = (25 - 22) + 2*(sqrt(114) - sqrt(105)) = 3 + 2*(sqrt(114) - sqrt(105)).\n\nSo, exact expression is 3 + 2*(sqrt(114) - sqrt(105)). So, to confirm whether this is positive, we can see that sqrt(114) - sqrt(105) is positive, so 2*(positive) is positive, added to 3, so overall positive.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether sqrt(114) is more than sqrt(105) + 0.5 or something, but I think the approximate calculation was sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the exact numerical value of A² - B².\n\nCompute sqrt(114) ≈ 10.680, sqrt(105) ≈ 10.247.\n\nSo sqrt(114) - sqrt(105) ≈ 10.680 - 10.247 ≈ 0.433.\n\nMultiply by 2: ≈ 0.866.\n\nAdd 3: ≈ 3.866.\n\nSo, A² - B² ≈ 3.866, which is positive. Therefore, A > B.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that sqrt(6) + sqrt(19) is larger than sqrt(7) + sqrt(15).\n\nTherefore, the answer is sqrt(6) + sqrt(19), which is already in the desired form. So, I can write that as the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{19}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{19}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{15}\\), we can square both expressions and compare the results.\n\nLet \\(A = \\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{19}\\) and \\(B = \\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{15}\\).\n\nFirst, we square \\(A\\):\n\\[\nA^2 = (\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{19})^2 = 6 + 2\\sqrt{6 \\cdot 19} + 19 = 25 + 2\\sqrt{114}\n\\]\n\nNext, we square \\(B\\):\n\\[\nB^2 = (\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{15})^2 = 7 + 2\\sqrt{7 \\cdot 15} + 15 = 22 + 2\\sqrt{105}\n\\]\n\nWe then compare \\(A^2\\) and \\(B^"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(4) + sqrt(33) and sqrt(6) + sqrt(12). Then I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger one in the form of sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should compute the numerical values of both expressions to see which one is bigger. That might not be too bad. Let me start with sqrt(4). I know that sqrt(4) is 2 because 2 times 2 is 4. So that part is straightforward.\n\nNext, sqrt(33). Hmm, I don't know the exact value of sqrt(33), but I know that sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(33) must be somewhere between 5 and 6. Maybe closer to 5.7 or something? Let me try to approximate it. Let's see, 5.7 squared is 32.49, which is pretty close to 33. So sqrt(33) is approximately 5.744. Maybe I should carry more decimal places for better accuracy, but perhaps for the sake of comparison, I can just go with this approximate value.\n\nSo adding sqrt(4) and sqrt(33), we get 2 + 5.744, which is about 7.744. Okay, that's the first expression.\n\nNow the second expression is sqrt(6) + sqrt(12). Let me compute each of these separately. I know that sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449 because 2.449 squared is roughly 6. And sqrt(12) is sqrt(4*3) which is 2*sqrt(3), right? So sqrt(12) is approximately 3.464 because sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(12) is somewhere in between. Let me double-check: 3.464 squared is 12 because 3 squared is 9, 0.464 squared is approximately 0.215, and 2*3*0.464 is approximately 2.784. Adding them up: 9 + 2.784 + 0.215 is roughly 12. So sqrt(12) is approximately 3.464.\n\nAdding sqrt(6) and sqrt(12), we get 2.449 + 3.464, which is approximately 5.913. Wait, that seems less than the first expression. Hmm, did I do that right? Because 2 + 5.744 is 7.744, and 2.449 + 3.464 is 5.913. So that would mean sqrt(4) + sqrt(33) is larger.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should be more precise with the square roots to make sure. Let me try to compute more accurately. Let's see:\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(4) + sqrt(33) = 2 + sqrt(33). Let me compute sqrt(33) more accurately. So sqrt(33) is between 5.7 and 5.8. Let's try 5.744 squared: 5.744 * 5.744. Let's compute 5*5 = 25, 5*0.744 = 3.72, 0.744*5 = 3.72, and 0.744*0.744 is approximately 0.553. Adding all these together: 25 + 3.72 + 3.72 + 0.553 = 33. So sqrt(33) is indeed about 5.744.\n\nSo 2 + 5.744 is 7.744.\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(6) + sqrt(12). Let me compute sqrt(6) and sqrt(12) more accurately.\n\nsqrt(6) is approximately 2.449489743. Let me check: 2.449489743 squared is 6? Let me compute 2.449489743 * 2.449489743:\n\nFirst, 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nThen, 2 * 0.449489743 = 0.898979486.\n\nThen, 0.449489743 * 2 = 0.898979486.\n\nAnd finally, 0.449489743 * 0.449489743. Let me compute that: (approx 0.45)^2 is 0.2025, but more precisely, 0.449489743 * 0.449489743 is approximately 0.2022.\n\nAdding all together: 4 + 0.898979486 + 0.898979486 + 0.2022 ≈ 4 + 1.797958972 + 0.2022 ≈ 6.000158972, which is very close to 6. So sqrt(6) is indeed approximately 2.4495.\n\nNow, sqrt(12) is approximately 3.464101615. Let me verify that: 3.464101615 squared. Let's compute it:\n\n3^2 = 9.\n\n2*3*0.464101615 = 2.78460979.\n\n0.464101615^2 ≈ 0.2154.\n\nAdding all together: 9 + 2.78460979 + 0.2154 ≈ 12. So that's correct.\n\nSo adding sqrt(6) and sqrt(12): 2.4495 + 3.464101615 ≈ 5.913601615.\n\nSo sqrt(4) + sqrt(33) ≈ 7.744, and sqrt(6) + sqrt(12) ≈ 5.9136. So 7.744 is definitely larger.\n\nBut wait, I have another thought: is there a way to compare these expressions without calculating their approximate decimal values? Maybe by squaring both and comparing? Let me try that because sometimes squaring can help avoid decimal approximations.\n\nSo, let me denote A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(33) = 2 + sqrt(33). And B = sqrt(6) + sqrt(12). I want to compare A and B.\n\nTo compare A and B, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and see which is larger. If A^2 > B^2, then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nLet me compute A^2: (sqrt(4) + sqrt(33))^2 = (2)^2 + 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(33) + (sqrt(33))^2 = 4 + 2*sqrt(132) + 33 = 37 + 2*sqrt(132).\n\nSimilarly, B^2: (sqrt(6) + sqrt(12))^2 = (sqrt(6))^2 + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(12) + (sqrt(12))^2 = 6 + 2*sqrt(72) + 12 = 18 + 2*sqrt(72).\n\nSo now, I have A^2 = 37 + 2*sqrt(132) and B^2 = 18 + 2*sqrt(72). I need to compare 37 + 2*sqrt(132) and 18 + 2*sqrt(72).\n\nSubtracting the two, A^2 - B^2 = (37 - 18) + 2*(sqrt(132) - sqrt(72)) = 19 + 2*(sqrt(132) - sqrt(72)).\n\nSo, now I need to figure out whether sqrt(132) - sqrt(72) is positive or negative.\n\nCompute sqrt(132): sqrt(121 + 11) = sqrt(132). Well, 11^2 is 121, so sqrt(132) is a bit more than 11. Specifically, 11.5^2 is 132.25, so sqrt(132) is approximately 11.489.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(72): 8^2 is 64, 9^2 is 81, so sqrt("

Well, 19 is obviously smaller than 66, so sqrt(66) should be larger than sqrt(19).\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(66) is larger than 2*sqrt(19). \n\nHence, A² is larger than B². \n\nSince both A and B are positive numbers (square roots are positive), if A² > B², then A > B. \n\nTherefore, sqrt(11) + sqrt(24) is larger than sqrt(16) + sqrt(19).\n\nBut wait, just to double-check, let me compute both A and B numerically to confirm.\n\nCalculating A:\n\nsqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166\nsqrt(24) ≈ 4.89898\nAdding them: 3.3166 + 4.89898 ≈ 8.21556\n\nCalculating B:\n\nsqrt(16) = 4\nsqrt(19) ≈ 4.3589\nAdding them: 4 + 4.3589 ≈ 8.3589\n\nComparing the two, A ≈ 8.21556 and B ≈ 8.3589.

So approximate:\n\n34.8x ≈ 1.24 => x ≈ 1.24 / 34.8 ≈ 0.0355\n\nSo, sqrt(304) ≈ 17.4 + 0.0355 ≈ 17.4355\n\nThus, 2*sqrt(304) ≈ 2*17.4355 ≈ 34.871\n\nTherefore, B² = 35 + 34.871 ≈ 69.871\n\nWait, but earlier I thought B² was approximately 43.7178. That was incorrect. So,"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(7) + sqrt(41) and sqrt(12) + sqrt(33). I guess I need to figure out which one is bigger. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, maybe I can compute the approximate values of each square root to get a sense of their sizes. That might help me see which sum is larger.\n\nLet me start with sqrt(7). I know that sqrt(4) is 2 and sqrt(9) is 3, so sqrt(7) should be somewhere between 2 and 3. To get a better estimate, I can remember that 2.6 squared is 6.76 and 2.7 squared is 7.29. So sqrt(7) is approximately 2.645.\n\nNext, sqrt(41). Hmm, sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(41) should be a bit more than 6. Let me calculate 6.4 squared: 6.4 * 6.4 = 40.96. Oh, that's really close to 41. So sqrt(41) is approximately 6.403.\n\nSo, sqrt(7) + sqrt(41) is roughly 2.645 + 6.403, which adds up to about 9.048.\n\nNow, let's do the same for sqrt(12) and sqrt(33). Starting with sqrt(12). I know sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(12) is between 3 and 4. Let me see, 3.4 squared is 11.56, 3.5 squared is 12.25. So sqrt(12) is approximately 3.464.\n\nMoving on to sqrt(33). sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(33) is between 5 and 6. Let me calculate 5.7 squared: 5.7 * 5.7 = 32.49, which is just below 33. Then 5.8 squared is 33.64. So sqrt(33) is approximately 5.744.\n\nAdding those together, sqrt(12) + sqrt(33) is roughly 3.464 + 5.744, which adds up to approximately 9.208.\n\nComparing the two sums: sqrt(7) + sqrt(41) is about 9.048, and sqrt(12) + sqrt(33) is about 9.208. So, sqrt(12) + sqrt(33) seems to be larger.\n\nBut wait, let me check my approximations because sometimes approximations can be misleading. Maybe I should try a more precise method or see if there's a way to compare them without approximating so much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both sums and compare the squares. That might eliminate some of the decimal approximations.\n\nLet's denote A = sqrt(7) + sqrt(41) and B = sqrt(12) + sqrt(33). I want to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square A, I get A² = (sqrt(7) + sqrt(41))² = 7 + 2*sqrt(7*41) + 41 = 48 + 2*sqrt(287).\n\nSimilarly, squaring B, I get B² = (sqrt(12) + sqrt(33))² = 12 + 2*sqrt(12*33) + 33 = 45 + 2*sqrt(396).\n\nNow, let's compute these squares numerically.\n\nFirst, sqrt(287). Let me see, 17 squared is 289, so sqrt(287) is approximately 16.942.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(287) is about 2*16.942 = 33.884.\n\nTherefore, A² = 48 + 33.884 = 81.884.\n\nNext, sqrt(396). Let's calculate that. 19 squared is 361, 20 squared is 400, so sqrt(396) is between 19 and 20. 19.9 squared is 396.01. Oh, wow, that's very close. So sqrt(396) is approximately 19.9.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(396) is about 2*19.9 = 39.8.\n\nSo, B² = 45 + 39.8 = 84.8.\n\nSo, now, comparing A² and B²: 81.884 vs. 84.800. Since 84.8 is greater than 81.884, that means B² > A², so B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(12) + sqrt(33) is larger than sqrt(7) + sqrt(41).\n\nWait a second, this is consistent with my earlier approximation method. So, that must be the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about another method. Maybe the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something else?\n\nBut perhaps it's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think of these numbers as sums of square roots and see if there's a way to relate them.\n\nWait, I recall that for positive numbers a, b, c, d, (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))² + (sqrt(c) + sqrt(d))² = a + b + c + d + 2*(sqrt(ac) + sqrt(ad) + sqrt(bc) + sqrt(bd)). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the difference between B and A and see if it's positive.\n\nCompute B - A = sqrt(12) + sqrt(33) - sqrt(7) - sqrt(41).\n\nIs this positive?\n\nWell, from earlier, A² = 81.884 and B² = 84.800, so B > A, which means B - A is positive.\n\nBut if I wanted to compute the exact value, perhaps I can calculate sqrt(12) - sqrt(7) and sqrt(33) - sqrt(41), but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider pairing terms: sqrt(12) - sqrt(7) and sqrt(33) - sqrt(41).\n\nCompute sqrt(12) - sqrt(7) ≈ 3.464 - 2.645 ≈ 0.819.\n\nCompute sqrt(33) - sqrt(41) ≈ 5.744 - 6.403 ≈ -0.659.\n\nSo, the first term is positive, the second term is negative. So, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if I can find if B² - A² is positive, which we already saw it is: 84.8 - 81.884 ≈ 2.916, which is positive.\n\nSo, that confirms that B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, after computing the squares and comparing them, I can confidently say that sqrt(12) + sqrt(33) is larger than sqrt(7) + sqrt(41).\n\nI think that's solid. So, the larger number is sqrt(12) + sqrt(33), which can be written as \\boxed{\\sqrt{12} + \\sqrt{33}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{12} + \\sqrt{33}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{41}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{12} + \\sqrt{33}\\), we can approximate their values and then compare the squares of these sums.\n\nFirst, we approximate the values of the square roots:\n- \\(\\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.645\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{41} \\approx 6.403\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{12} \\approx 3.464\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{33} \\approx 5.744\\)\n\nNext, we calculate the sums:\n- \\(\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{41} \\approx 2.645 + 6.403 = 9.048\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{12} + \\sqrt{33} \\approx 3.464 + 5.744 = 9.208\\)\n\nWe then square these sums to eliminate the square roots:\n- \\((\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{41})^2 = 48 + 2\\sqrt{287} \\approx 48 + 2 \\times 16.942 = 81.884\\)\n- \\((\\sqrt{12} + \\sqrt{33})^2 = 45 + 2\\sqrt{"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(11) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(34) + sqrt(35). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out which is larger: sqrt(11) + sqrt(50) or sqrt(34) + sqrt(35). Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding what each of these square roots is approximately equal to. That way, I can maybe get a sense of their sizes without dealing with complicated calculations.\n\nFirst, sqrt(11). I know that sqrt(9) is 3, and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(11) must be somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me see, 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16. 11 is closer to 9, so it should be a bit less than 3.5. Maybe around 3.3 or 3.4?\n\nTo get a better estimate, let's try 3.3 squared: 3.3 * 3.3 is 10.89. That's pretty close to 11, but still a bit short. So maybe sqrt(11) is approximately 3.3166, since 3.3166 squared is roughly 11. Let me confirm that: 3.3166 * 3.3166. Let's do it step by step: 3 * 3 is 9, 3 * 0.3166 is about 0.9498, 0.3166 * 3 is another 0.9498, and 0.3166 * 0.3166 is approximately 0.0999. Adding all these together: 9 + 0.9498 + 0.9498 + 0.0999 is approximately 10.9995, which is roughly 11. So yeah, sqrt(11) is approximately 3.3166.\n\nNext, sqrt(50). Hmm, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(50) must be just a bit more than 7. Let me calculate 7.07 squared. 7 * 7 is 49, 7 * 0.07 is 0.49, 0.07 * 7 is another 0.49, and 0.07 squared is 0.0049. Adding those: 49 + 0.49 + 0.49 + 0.0049 is 50. So sqrt(50) is approximately 7.07.\n\nSo sqrt(11) is about 3.3166 and sqrt(50) is about 7.07. Adding them together: 3.3166 + 7.07 is roughly 10.3866.\n\nAlright, now let me tackle the other expression: sqrt(34) + sqrt(35). Let's break this down as well.\n\nFirst, sqrt(34). I know that sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(34) must be between 5 and 6. Let me get a better approximation. 5.8 squared is 33.64 because 5.8 * 5.8 is 33.64. That's pretty close to 34. So 5.8 squared is 33.64, which means sqrt(34) is a bit more than 5.8. Let me try 5.83 squared: 5.83 * 5.83. Let's compute this:\n\n5 * 5 is 25.\n\n5 * 0.83 is 4.15.\n\n0.83 * 5 is another 4.15.\n\n0.83 * 0.83 is approximately 0.6889.\n\nAdding all these together: 25 + 4.15 + 4.15 + 0.6889 is 25 + 8.3 + 0.6889, which is 33.6889. That's very close to 34. So sqrt(34) is approximately 5.8309.\n\nNext, sqrt(35). Since sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(35) is just a bit less than 6. Let's see, 5.9 squared is 34.81, which is just below 35. So sqrt(35) is a bit more than 5.9. Let me try 5.92 squared: 5.92 * 5.92. Let's compute that:\n\n5 * 5 = 25.\n\n5 * 0.92 = 4.6.\n\n0.92 * 5 = 4.6.\n\n0.92 * 0.92 ≈ 0.8464.\n\nAdding them up: 25 + 4.6 + 4.6 + 0.8464 = 25 + 9.2 + 0.8464 = 35.0464. That's a bit more than 35, so sqrt(35) is a bit less than 5.92. Maybe around 5.916.\n\nWait, actually, let me do it more precisely. Let me try 5.916 squared:\n\n5.916 * 5.916.\n\nFirst, 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n5 * 0.916 = 4.58.\n\n0.916 * 5 = 4.58.\n\n0.916 * 0.916 ≈ 0.839.\n\nAdding them up: 25 + 4.58 + 4.58 + 0.839 ≈ 25 + 9.16 + 0.839 ≈ 34.999 ≈ 35. So sqrt(35) is approximately 5.916.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nsqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166\n\nsqrt(50) ≈ 7.07\n\nSo sqrt(11) + sqrt(50) ≈ 3.3166 + 7.07 ≈ 10.3866.\n\nsqrt(34) ≈ 5.8309\n\nsqrt(35) ≈ 5.916\n\nSo sqrt(34) + sqrt(35) ≈ 5.8309 + 5.916 ≈ 11.7469.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't sound right. 5.8309 + 5.916 is approximately 11.7469? But 5.8309 + 5.916 is 5.8309 + 5.916. Let me compute that: 5 + 5 is 10, 0.8309 + 0.916 is approximately 1.7469, so total is 11.7469. That seems high, but considering sqrt(34) and sqrt(35) are each around 5.8 and 5.9, adding them should get close to 11.7.\n\nBut wait, earlier, sqrt(11) + sqrt(50) was approximately 10.3866, and sqrt(34) + sqrt(35) was approximately 11.7469. So which is larger? 11.7469 is larger than 10.3866, so sqrt(34) + sqrt(35) is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my estimates because 5.8309 + 5.916 is indeed around 11.7469, but maybe I should verify these square roots more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of approximating, I can square both expressions to compare them directly.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(11) + sqrt(50) and B = sqrt(34) + sqrt(35). I need to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square A: A^2 = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(50))^2 = 11 + 50 + 2*sqrt(11*50) = 61 + 2*sqrt(550).\n\nSimilarly, squaring B: B^2 = (sqrt(34) + sqrt(35))^2 = 34 + 35 + 2*sqrt(34*35) = 69 + 2*sqrt(1190).\n\nSo, A^2 = 61 + 2*sqrt(550)\n\nB^2 = 69 + 2*sqrt(1190)\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(550) and sqrt(1190). Let me see.\n\nsqrt(550): 550 is between 576 (24^2) and 529 (2"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(5) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(15) + sqrt(42). I need to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't behave like regular numbers. So maybe I should try to simplify or find a common ground for these expressions. Let me write them down again:\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(5) + sqrt(50)\nExpression 2: sqrt(15) + sqrt(42)\n\nI wonder if I can express both expressions in a similar form or perhaps find a way to compare their approximate values. Maybe I can compute each side numerically and then see which one is larger. That might be straightforward, although it might not give me the exact answer. But it could serve as a check.\n\nLet me try that. I'll compute each square root separately and then add them up.\n\nStarting with Expression 1:\n\nsqrt(5) is approximately 2.23607\nsqrt(50) is approximately 7.07107\nAdding them together: 2.23607 + 7.07107 ≈ 9.30714\n\nNow, Expression 2:\n\nsqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298\nsqrt(42) is approximately 6.48074\nAdding them together: 3.87298 + 6.48074 ≈ 10.35372\n\nHmm, so based on these approximate values, Expression 2 is about 10.35372, and Expression 1 is about 9.30714. So that suggests that sqrt(15) + sqrt(42) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(50). But wait, I should probably check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me verify sqrt(50). Since sqrt(50) is sqrt(25*2) which is 5*sqrt(2). sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so 5*1.4142 = 7.071, which is correct.\n\nAnd sqrt(5) is about 2.236, that's right. Adding them together, 2.236 + 7.071 is indeed about 9.307.\n\nNow, sqrt(15): sqrt(9*1.666...) is sqrt(9) times sqrt(1.666...) which is 3 times approximately 1.291, so 3.874. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298, which is correct. And sqrt(42): since 6^2 is 36 and 7^2 is 49, so sqrt(42) is between 6 and 7. 6.4^2 is 40.96, which is close to 42. So sqrt(42) is approximately 6.48074. That's correct.\n\nAdding 3.87298 + 6.48074: let's compute that step by step. 3 + 6 is 9. 0.87298 + 0.48074 is approximately 1.35372. So total is 9 + 1.35372, which is approximately 10.35372. That seems correct.\n\nSo, based on numerical approximation, Expression 2 is larger. But maybe I should try another approach to see if this is indeed the case. Perhaps I can square both expressions and compare them instead, which can sometimes give a clearer answer.\n\nLet me denote Expression 1 as A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(50) and Expression 2 as B = sqrt(15) + sqrt(42).\n\nIf I square both A and B, I can compare A^2 and B^2. Since both A and B are positive, their squares will preserve the inequality.\n\nSo, A^2 = (sqrt(5) + sqrt(50))^2 = (sqrt(5))^2 + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(50) + (sqrt(50))^2\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(15) + sqrt(42))^2 = (sqrt(15))^2 + 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(42) + (sqrt(42))^2\n\nCalculating A^2:\n\n= 5 + 2*sqrt(250) + 50\n= (5 + 50) + 2*sqrt(250)\n= 55 + 2*sqrt(250)\n\nNote that sqrt(250) is sqrt(25*10) = 5*sqrt(10). So,\n\nA^2 = 55 + 2*(5*sqrt(10)) = 55 + 10*sqrt(10)\n\nSimilarly, let's compute B^2:\n\n= 15 + 2*sqrt(630) + 42\n= (15 + 42) + 2*sqrt(630)\n= 57 + 2*sqrt(630)\n\nNow, sqrt(630): 630 is 9*70, so sqrt(630) = 3*sqrt(70). Let's keep that in mind.\n\nSo, B^2 = 57 + 2*3*sqrt(70) = 57 + 6*sqrt(70)\n\nNow, we have A^2 = 55 + 10*sqrt(10) and B^2 = 57 + 6*sqrt(70). So, to compare A^2 and B^2, we can look at the difference:\n\nB^2 - A^2 = (57 + 6*sqrt(70)) - (55 + 10*sqrt(10)) = 2 + 6*sqrt(70) - 10*sqrt(10)\n\nSo, if B^2 - A^2 is positive, then B^2 > A^2, which would mean B > A. If it's negative, then A > B.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute whether 2 + 6*sqrt(70) - 10*sqrt(10) is positive.\n\nLet me compute each term numerically:\n\nsqrt(70) is approximately 8.3666\nsqrt(10) is approximately 3.1622\n\nSo, 6*sqrt(70) ≈ 6*8.3666 ≈ 50.1996\n10*sqrt(10) ≈ 10*3.1622 ≈ 31.622\n\nTherefore, B^2 - A^2 ≈ 2 + 50.1996 - 31.622 ≈ 2 + 18.5776 ≈ 20.5776\n\nWhich is positive. Thus, B^2 > A^2, which implies B > A.\n\nSo, this method also shows that sqrt(15) + sqrt(42) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(50). So, the answer should be sqrt(15) + sqrt(42).\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can also try another approach, perhaps using some algebraic identities or inequalities.\n\nI remember that for positive numbers a and b, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) can be compared by considering the functions involved.\n\nBut perhaps another way is to note that both sqrt(5) + sqrt(50) and sqrt(15) + sqrt(42) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(5) and sqrt(15). Let me see.\n\nWait, sqrt(50) is 5*sqrt(2) and sqrt(42) is sqrt(21*2) = sqrt(21)*sqrt(2). So, perhaps I can factor out sqrt(2) from both expressions.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(5) + sqrt(50) = sqrt(5) + 5*sqrt(2)\nExpression 2: sqrt(15) + sqrt(42) = sqrt(15) + sqrt(21)*sqrt(2)\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write both expressions in terms of sqrt(2). Let's see.\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(5) + 5*sqrt(2) = sqrt(5) + 5*sqrt(2)\nExpression 2: sqrt(15) + sqrt(21)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(15) + sqrt(21)*sqrt(2)\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the difference between the two expressions and see if it's positive.\n\nLet’s denote C = sqrt(15) + sqrt(42) - (sqrt"

So, sqrt(36) is 6. What about sqrt(8)? Hmm, 8 isn't a perfect square, but I do know that 2 squared is 4 and 3 squared is 9, so sqrt(8) must be somewhere between 2 and 3. Maybe I can approximate it or find a way to express it differently.\n\nWait, sqrt(8) can be simplified because 8 is 4 times 2. Since sqrt(4*2) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(2), that simplifies to 2*sqrt(2). Okay, so sqrt(8) is 2*sqrt(2). That might be helpful later. Let me write that down: sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2). So the first expression becomes 2*sqrt(2) + 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(16) + sqrt(30). Again, sqrt(16) is straightforward because 4 squared is 16, so sqrt(16) is 4. What about sqrt(30)? 30 isn't a perfect square, but it's between 25 (5 squared) and 36 (6 squared). So sqrt(30) is between 5 and 6. Let me see if I can get a better approximation or maybe express it in a different way.\n\nHmm, 30 can be broken down into 25 + 5, but I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it differently. 30 is 3*10, so sqrt(30) is sqrt(3*10). That doesn't particularly help me much. Maybe I can use a calculator approximation? Wait, but in this case, since I'm comparing expressions, maybe I don't need to approximate them. Let's see.\n\nSo, the second expression is 4 + sqrt(30). I know that sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477, right? Because 5.477 squared is about 30. Let me confirm that: 5.477 * 5.477. Let's compute 5*5 is 25, 0.477*5 is about 2.385, and 0.477*0.477 is approximately 0.227. Adding those up: 25 + 2.385 + 0.227 is around 27.612. Wait, that's not 30. Hmm, maybe my approximation is off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square 5.477 to see if it's 30. Let's compute 5.477^2: 5^2 is 25, 2*5*0.477 is about 4.77, and 0.477^2 is approximately 0.227. So adding those up: 25 + 4.77 + 0.227 is about 30.0. Okay, so 5.477 squared is approximately 30. So, sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477. Therefore, the second expression is 4 + 5.477, which is about 9.477.\n\nNow, let's go back to the first expression: sqrt(8) + sqrt(36) is 2*sqrt(2) + 6. I know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414. So, 2*1.414 is about 2.828. Adding that to 6 gives 8.828. So, the first expression is approximately 8.828, and the second is approximately 9.477. So, clearly, the second expression is larger.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, which one is larger? The second expression, sqrt(16) + sqrt(30), which is approximately 9.477. So, I need to express this as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). But I already have sqrt(16) and sqrt(30). So, a is 16 and b is 30.\n\nBut let me double-check just to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nFirst expression: sqrt(8) + sqrt(36). sqrt(8) is 2*sqrt(2), which is approximately 2.828, and sqrt(36) is 6. So, 2.828 + 6 is 8.828. That's correct.\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(16) + sqrt(30). sqrt(16) is 4, and sqrt(30) is approximately 5.477. So, 4 + 5.477 is 9.477. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the second expression is larger. So, the larger number is sqrt(16) + sqrt(30). Therefore, I should write that as the answer.\n\nBut hold on, the problem says \"Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\" So, does that mean I have to express the larger number as a sum of two square roots, possibly different from the original ones? Hmm, or is it just to note that the larger number is sqrt(16) + sqrt(30)?\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"Compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(30). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b).\" So, it seems they just want the larger number expressed as sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, in this case, the larger number is sqrt(16) + sqrt(30), so I can just write that as the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me see if I can express the larger number in another way. For example, can I write sqrt(16) + sqrt(30) as another combination? Well, sqrt(16) is 4, and sqrt(30) is about 5.477, so unless there's a way to write sqrt(30) as a combination of other square roots, I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compare the two expressions without approximating. Let me see if I can find a way to compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(30) algebraically.\n\nSo, let me denote A = sqrt(8) + sqrt(36) and B = sqrt(16) + sqrt(30). I need to compare A and B. Let's compute A^2 and B^2 to see which one is larger because squaring preserves the order for positive numbers.\n\nCompute A^2: (sqrt(8) + sqrt(36))^2 = (sqrt(8))^2 + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(36) + (sqrt(36))^2 = 8 + 2*sqrt(288) + 36 = 44 + 2*sqrt(288).\n\nCompute B^2: (sqrt(16) + sqrt(30))^2 = (sqrt(16))^2 + 2*sqrt(16)*sqrt(30) + (sqrt(30))^2 = 16 + 2*sqrt(480) + 30 = 46 + 2*sqrt(480).\n\nNow, let me compare A^2 and B^2: A^2 is 44 + 2*sqrt(288) and B^2 is 46 + 2*sqrt(480). So, which one is larger?\n\nCompute sqrt(288) and sqrt(480). I can factor these:\n\n288 = 144 * 2, so sqrt(288) = sqrt(144*2) = 12*sqrt(2) ≈ 12*1.414 ≈ 16.968.\n\nSimilarly, 480 = 16*30, so sqrt(480) = sqrt(16*30) = 4*sqrt(30) ≈ 4*5.477 ≈ 21.9"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to compare sqrt(14) + sqrt(38) and sqrt(19) + sqrt(28). Hmm, okay, I guess I need to figure out which one is bigger. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes comparing square roots directly can be tricky because they don't play nice like whole numbers. Maybe I can find a way to square both expressions to make them easier to compare. Yeah, that might work. If I square sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), I get a + 2*sqrt(ab) + b. So, squaring both expressions might help me figure out which one is larger.\n\nLet me write that down. Let’s denote A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(38). Then, A squared would be (sqrt(14) + sqrt(38))^2. Similarly, let me denote B = sqrt(19) + sqrt(28), so B squared is (sqrt(19) + sqrt(28))^2.\n\nCalculating A squared:\n\nA² = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(38))² = 14 + 2*sqrt(14*38) + 38. Let me compute 14 + 38 first. 14 + 38 is 52. Then, 14*38 is... let me do that multiplication. 14 times 38: 10*38 is 380, and 4*38 is 152, so 380 + 152 is 532. So, sqrt(14*38) is sqrt(532). Hmm, okay, that's a bit messy, but I can leave it as sqrt(532) for now.\n\nSo, A² = 52 + 2*sqrt(532). Similarly, let me compute B squared.\n\nB² = (sqrt(19) + sqrt(28))² = 19 + 2*sqrt(19*28) + 28. Let me add 19 and 28 first. 19 + 28 is 47. Then, 19*28: 20*28 is 560, minus 1*28 is 28, so 560 - 28 is 532. So, sqrt(19*28) is sqrt(532) as well.\n\nSo, B² = 47 + 2*sqrt(532). Now, I have both A² and B² in terms of numbers and sqrt(532). Let me write them again:\n\nA² = 52 + 2*sqrt(532)\nB² = 47 + 2*sqrt(532)\n\nNow, since both expressions have 2*sqrt(532), which is the same, I can subtract that from both to compare the remaining parts.\n\nSo, A² - 2*sqrt(532) = 52\nB² - 2*sqrt(532) = 47\n\nSince 52 is greater than 47, that implies that A² is greater than B². Therefore, A must be greater than B because both A and B are positive numbers (square roots are positive).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, I squared both expressions and compared A² and B². Since A² is greater, then A must be greater than B. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute approximate values for A and B to see which one is larger. Sometimes, exact squares can be deceptive, so it's good to check with actual numbers.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(14) approximately. 3^2 is 9, 4^2 is 16. So, sqrt(14) is somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me get a better estimate. 3.7^2 is 13.69, which is less than 14. 3.73^2 is approximately 13.9129, still less. 3.74^2 is 13.9876, getting closer. 3.75^2 is 14.0625, which is more than 14. So, sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(38). Let me see. 6^2 is 36, 7^2 is 49. So, sqrt(38) is between 6 and 7. 6.1^2 is 37.21, which is less than 38. 6.2^2 is 38.44, which is more than 38. So, sqrt(38) is approximately 6.1644.\n\nSo, A is approximately 3.7417 + 6.1644. Let me add those: 3.7417 + 6.1644. 3 + 6 is 9. 0.7417 + 0.1644 is approximately 0.9061. So, total is approximately 9.9061.\n\nNow, let's compute B, which is sqrt(19) + sqrt(28). Again, sqrt(19): between 4 and 5. 4.3^2 is 18.49, 4.4^2 is 19.36. So, sqrt(19) is approximately 4.3589.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(28): 5^2 is 25, 6^2 is 36, so sqrt(28) is between 5 and 6. 5.3^2 is 28.09, which is just a bit over 28. So, sqrt(28) is approximately 5.2915.\n\nTherefore, B is approximately 4.3589 + 5.2915. Adding those: 4 + 5 is 9, 0.3589 + 0.2915 is approximately 0.6504. So, total is approximately 9.6504.\n\nComparing A and B: A is approximately 9.9061, B is approximately 9.6504. So, A is greater than B.\n\nThat matches with what I found earlier when I squared both expressions. So, A is bigger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the exact values of A and B using more precise approximations.\n\nLet me use a calculator for more accurate square roots.\n\nsqrt(14): let me compute this.\n\nsqrt(14) is approximately 3.74165738677. Let me take that as 3.741657.\n\nsqrt(38): let me compute.\n\nsqrt(38) is approximately 6.164414. Let me take that as 6.164414.\n\nSo, A = 3.741657 + 6.164414. Let's add those.\n\n3.741657 + 6.164414:\n\n3 + 6 = 9\n\n0.741657 + 0.164414 = 0.906071\n\nSo, total is 9.906071.\n\nNow, for B:\n\nsqrt(19) is approximately 4.35889894354.\n\nsqrt(28) is approximately 5.29150262212.\n\nSo, B = 4.35889894354 + 5.29150262212.\n\nAdding those:\n\n4 + 5 = 9\n\n0.35889894354 + 0.29150262212 ≈ 0.65040156566\n\nSo, total is approximately 9.65040156566.\n\nTherefore, A is approximately 9.906071, and B is approximately 9.650402. So, A is definitely larger.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my initial conclusion.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, is there any other way to compare sqrt(14) + sqrt(38) and sqrt(19) + sqrt(28) without squaring? Maybe by some inequality?\n\nI remember that for positive numbers, if a² > b², then a > b. So, in this case, since A² > B², then A > B. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something.\n\nBut I think the squaring method is the most straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the difference between A and B and see if it's positive.\n\nLet me"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(17) + sqrt(37) is larger than sqrt(21) + sqrt(34) or vice versa. Hmm, let's see. I remember that sometimes when you have square roots, you can compare them by squaring both expressions to make it easier. Maybe that's the way to go here.\n\nAlright, let's denote A as sqrt(17) + sqrt(37) and B as sqrt(21) + sqrt(34). So, I need to find out if A > B or B > A. To do this, I'll square both A and B and then compare the results. That should give me some information.\n\nLet's start with A squared. So, A² = (sqrt(17) + sqrt(37))². I know that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so applying that formula here:\n\nA² = (sqrt(17))² + 2*sqrt(17)*sqrt(37) + (sqrt(37))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nsqrt(17) squared is 17, same with sqrt(37) squared is 37. So, adding those up gives 17 + 37 = 54. Then, the middle term is 2*sqrt(17*37). Let me compute 17*37 first. Hmm, 17*30 is 510, and 17*7 is 119, so adding those together gives 510 + 119 = 629. So, the middle term is 2*sqrt(629). I don't know the exact value, but I can keep it as is for now.\n\nSo, A² = 54 + 2*sqrt(629). Hmm, let's note that down.\n\nNow, let's do the same for B squared. B² = (sqrt(21) + sqrt(34))². Again, using the same expansion:\n\nB² = (sqrt(21))² + 2*sqrt(21)*sqrt(34) + (sqrt(34))²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nsqrt(21) squared is 21, sqrt(34) squared is 34. So, 21 + 34 = 55. Then, the middle term is 2*sqrt(21*34). Let's compute 21*34. 20*34 is 680, and 1*34 is 34, so total is 680 + 34 = 714. Therefore, the middle term is 2*sqrt(714).\n\nSo, B² = 55 + 2*sqrt(714). Alright, now I have both A² and B² expressed in terms of square roots, which is good.\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B² to see which one is larger. Let me write that down:\n\nA² = 54 + 2*sqrt(629)\nB² = 55 + 2*sqrt(714)\n\nHmm, so 54 is less than 55, so the difference between A² and B² is 1 - 2*(sqrt(629) - sqrt(714)). Wait, no, actually, it's A² - B² = (54 - 55) + 2*(sqrt(629) - sqrt(714)). So, A² - B² = -1 + 2*(sqrt(629) - sqrt(714)). So, if I can figure out whether sqrt(629) - sqrt(714) is more or less than 0.5, then I can determine whether A² is greater or less than B².\n\nWait, let me think about this. If sqrt(629) - sqrt(714) is positive, then 2*(sqrt(629) - sqrt(714)) would be positive, so A² would be -1 + positive. If that positive is greater than 1, then A² would be positive. If it's less than 1, then A² would be negative.\n\nSo, I need to figure out whether sqrt(629) is greater than sqrt(714) + 0.5 or not. But wait, sqrt(714) is about, let's see, sqrt(625) is 25, sqrt(676) is 26, sqrt(729) is 27. So, sqrt(714) is between 26.7 and 26.8. Let me approximate sqrt(714) as 26.7.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(629) is between 25.08 and 25.09. Wait, sqrt(625) is 25, sqrt(676) is 26, sqrt(629) is 25.08? Hmm, maybe I should check.\n\nWait, 25 squared is 625, so 25.08 squared is 25.08*25.08. Let's compute 25 * 25 = 625, 25 * 0.08 = 2, 0.08 * 25 = 2, and 0.08 * 0.08 = 0.0064. So, total is 625 + 2 + 2 + 0.0064 = 629.0064. So, 25.08 squared is approximately 629.0064, which is just over 629. So, sqrt(629) is approximately 25.08 - a tiny bit. Similarly, sqrt(714). Let's see, 26 squared is 676, 26.7 squared is approximately 26.7*26.7.\n\nWait, let's compute 26.7 squared. 26 squared is 676, 0.7 squared is 0.49, and then cross terms: 2*26*0.7 = 36.4. So, 676 + 36.4 + 0.49 = 712.89. So, 26.7 squared is approximately 712.89, which is just under 714. So, sqrt(714) is approximately 26.7 + (714 - 712.89)/(2*26.7). That would be 1.11 / 53.4, which is approximately 0.0208. So, sqrt(714) is approximately 26.7208.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(629) is approximately 25.08 - a tiny bit, but let's say approximately 25.08 - 0.003, which is about 25.077.\n\nSo, sqrt(629) - sqrt(714) is approximately 25.077 - 26.7208, which is approximately -1.6438.\n\nSo, sqrt(629) - sqrt(714) is approximately -1.6438.\n\nTherefore, 2*(sqrt(629) - sqrt(714)) is approximately -3.2876.\n\nSo, going back to A² - B² = -1 + 2*(sqrt(629) - sqrt(714)) ≈ -1 - 3.2876 ≈ -4.2876.\n\nSo, A² - B² ≈ -4.2876, which is negative. Therefore, A² < B², so A < B.\n\nWait, so that means sqrt(17) + sqrt(37) is less than sqrt(21) + sqrt(34). So, sqrt(21) + sqrt(34) is larger.\n\nLet me double-check my approximations because I might have messed up the sqrt(629) and sqrt(714) values.\n\nWait, sqrt(625) is 25, sqrt(676) is 26, sqrt(629) is 25.08 (approx). sqrt(714) is 26.72 (approx). So, 25.08 - 26.72 is about -1.64, so 2*(-1.64) is -3.28, plus the -1 is -4.28.\n\nSo, A² is about -4.28 less than B², which means A² is less than B². Therefore, A is less than B.\n\nSo, the larger number is sqrt(21) + sqrt(34). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(21) + sqrt(34).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe I can compare the two expressions without squaring. Let"

The question is asking which one is larger, and I need to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help because it turns the sum into something more manageable. But I also remember that squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions or make things more complicated, so I have to be careful.

Maybe instead, I should compare A² and B² directly.\n\nSo, A² = 73 + 2*sqrt(1222)\nB² = 87 + 2*sqrt(1892)\n\nI need to determine whether A² is greater than or less than B². Let's compute the difference:\n\nB² - A² = (87 + 2*sqrt(1892)) - (73 + 2*sqrt(1222)) = 14 + 2*sqrt(1892) - 2*sqrt(1222)\n\nSo, B² - A² = 14 + 2*(sqrt(1892) - sqrt(1222)). Let's see if this is positive or negative.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(1892). Let me approximate sqrt(1892). Well, 43² is 1849 and 44² is 1936. So sqrt(1892) is between 43 and 44. Let's approximate it.\n\n1892 - 1849 = 43. So sqrt(1892) ≈ 43 + 43/(2*43) = 43 + 1/2 = 43.5. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think. Maybe a better approximation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach:\n\nsqrt(1892) = sqrt(43² + 43) ≈ 43 + 43/(2*43) = 43 + 0.5 = 43.5. Hmm, but actually, 43.5² is 1892.25, which is very close to 1892. So, sqrt(1892) ≈ 43.5.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1222): 34² is 1156 and 35² is 1225. So sqrt(1222) is very close to 35. Let's approximate it.\n\n1222 - 1156 = 66. So sqrt(1222) ≈ 35 - 66/(2*35) = 35 - 66/70 ≈ 35 - 0.942 ≈ 34.058. Alternatively, 34.05² = ?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to just compute 34.05²:\n\n34² = 1156\n\n0.05² = 0.0025\n\nCross term: 2*34*0.05 = 3.4\n\nSo, (34 + 0.05)² = 34² + 2*34*0.05 + 0.05² = 1156 + 3.4 + 0.0025 ≈ 1159.4025\n\nBut 1222 is higher than 1159.4025. So, let's try 34.5²:\n\n34.5² = (34 + 0.5)² = 34² + 2*34*0.5 + 0.5² = 1156 + 34 + 0.25 = 1190.25\n\nStill lower than 1222. 34.75²:\n\n34.75² = (34 + 0.75)² = 34² + 2*34*0.75 + 0.75² = 1156 + 51 + 0.5625 = 1207.5625\n\nStill lower than 1222. 34.9²:\n\n34.9² = (34 + 0.9)² = 34² + 2*34*0.9 + 0.9² = 1156 + 61.2 + 0.81 = 1218.01\n\nStill lower than 1222. 34.95²:\n\n34.95² = (34 + 0.95)² = 34² + 2*34*0.95 + 0.95² = 1156 + 64.4 + 0.9025 ≈ 1221.3025\n\nThat's very close to 1222. So sqrt(1222) ≈ 34.95 + a tiny bit. Let's say approximately 34.955.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1892) ≈ 43.5 as we approximated earlier.\n\nSo now, let's compute sqrt(1892) - sqrt(1222) ≈ 43.5 - 34.955 ≈ 8.545.\n\nNow, plug that back into the expression for B² - A²:\n\nB² - A² = 14 + 2*(8.545) ≈ 14 + 17.09 ≈ 31.09\n\nSo, B² - A² ≈ 31.09, which is positive. Therefore, B² > A², which implies that B > A.\n\nSo, sqrt(43) + sqrt(44) is larger than sqrt(26) + sqrt(47).\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(43) + sqrt(44). So, I need to write that in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), which is already given, so the answer is sqrt(43) + sqrt(44).\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I made an approximation error somewhere. Let me verify the calculations.\n\nFirst, I computed A² = 73 + 2*sqrt(1222) and B² = 87 + 2*sqrt(1892). Then, I found that B² - A² = 14 + 2*(sqrt(1892) - sqrt(1222)). Then, I approximated sqrt(1892) as 43.5 and sqrt("

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to compare sqrt(20) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(27) + sqrt(33). Hmm, both are sums of square roots, so I guess I need to figure out which one is larger. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes you can compare square roots by their approximate decimal values. Maybe I can compute each of these square roots and then add them up to see which sum is bigger. That might be straightforward, but I wonder if there's a more precise way without using a calculator.\n\nLet me write down the numbers:\n\n- sqrt(20) + sqrt(43)\n- sqrt(27) + sqrt(33)\n\nOkay, so maybe I can compute each square root to a few decimal places. Let's start with sqrt(20). I know that sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(20) should be somewhere between 4 and 5. Let me try to approximate it. 4.5 squared is 20.25, which is just over 20. So sqrt(20) is a bit less than 4.5. Let's say approximately 4.472.\n\nNow, sqrt(43). Hmm, sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(43) is between 6 and 7. Let me see, 6.5 squared is 42.25, which is just under 43. So sqrt(43) is about 6.5 plus a bit. Maybe 6.56 or something. Let me check 6.56 squared: 6.56 * 6.56. Let's compute that:\n\n6.5 * 6.5 is 42.25, but 6.56 is 6.5 + 0.06. So using the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, it would be 42.25 + 2*(6.5)*(0.06) + (0.06)^2. Calculating:\n\n2*(6.5)*(0.06) = 2*0.39 = 0.78\n\n(0.06)^2 = 0.0036\n\nAdding them together: 42.25 + 0.78 = 43.03 + 0.0036 = 43.0336\n\nWow, so 6.56 squared is 43.0336, which is a bit over 43. So sqrt(43) is approximately 6.56 minus a little bit. Maybe 6.559? Let me verify 6.559 squared:\n\nFirst, 6.55 squared is 42.9025, as I did before. Adding 0.009 squared, which is 0.000081, so 6.559 squared is 42.9025 + 2*(6.55)*(0.009) + 0.009^2.\n\nCompute 2*(6.55)*(0.009) = 2*0.05895 = 0.1179\n\n0.009^2 = 0.000081\n\nSo total is 42.9025 + 0.1179 = 43.0204 + 0.000081 = 43.020481\n\nSo 6.559 squared is approximately 43.0205, which is just a bit over 43. So sqrt(43) is about 6.559. Let me note that.\n\nNow, moving on to sqrt(27). That's straightforward. I know sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(27) is between 5 and 6. Let's see, 5.1 squared is 26.01, which is just under 27. So sqrt(27) is around 5.196 or so. Let me compute 5.196 squared:\n\n5.196 * 5.196. Let's compute this:\n\n5 * 5 = 25\n\n5 * 0.196 = 0.98\n\n0.196 * 5 = 0.98\n\n0.196 * 0.196 ≈ 0.0384\n\nAdding them up: 25 + 0.98 + 0.98 + 0.0384 = 25 + 1.96 + 0.0384 = 26.9984\n\nWow, that's really close to 27. So sqrt(27) is approximately 5.196, because 5.196 squared is 27. So that's exact.\n\nNow, sqrt(33). Hmm, sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(33) is between 5 and 6. Let me try 5.744 squared, because 5.7 squared is 32.49, which is close to 33. Let me check 5.744 squared:\n\n5.744 * 5.744. Let's compute:\n\n5 * 5 = 25\n\n5 * 0.744 = 3.72\n\n0.744 * 5 = 3.72\n\n0.744 * 0.744 ≈ 0.5535\n\nAdding them up: 25 + 3.72 + 3.72 + 0.5535 = 25 + 7.44 + 0.5535 = 32.9935\n\nHmm, that's a bit under 33. So sqrt(33) is a bit over 5.744. Let's try 5.746 squared:\n\n5.746 * 5.746.\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n5 * 0.746 = 3.73\n\n0.746 * 5 = 3.73\n\n0.746^2 ≈ 0.5565\n\nAdding them: 25 + 3.73 + 3.73 + 0.5565 = 25 + 7.46 + 0.5565 = 32.9965\n\nStill a bit under 33. So let's try 5.75 squared:\n\n5.75 * 5.75 = 33.0625\n\nAh, that's over 33. So sqrt(33) is between 5.746 and 5.75. Let's take an approximate value of 5.746 and 5.747.\n\nWait, maybe I can use linear approximation between 5.744 and 5.75. At 5.744, the square is 32.9935, and at 5.75, it's 33.0625. So the difference between 33.0625 and 32.9935 is 0.069. So to get from 32.9935 to 33, we need an additional 0.0065. So the fraction is 0.0065 / 0.069 ≈ 0.094. So sqrt(33) is approximately 5.744 + 0.0094 ≈ 5.7534. Hmm, but that seems too high because 5.75 squared is 33.0625. Wait, no, 5.75 squared is 33.0625, which is over 33. So sqrt(33) is 5.75 minus a bit.\n\nWait, maybe I need to do a better approximation. Let me use the Newton-Raphson method. Let me set f(x) = x^2 - 33. We know that at x=5.75, f(x)=33.0625 -33=0.0625. We need to find x where f(x)=0.\n\nSo, x0=5.75, f(x0)=0.0625\n\nf'(x0)=2x0=11.5\n\nSo, x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 5.75 - 0.0625 /11.5 ≈5.75 - 0.005434 ≈5.744566\n\nSo, x1≈5.744"

I need to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that sqrt(9) is 3 because 3 squared is 9. So that part is straightforward. The other terms are radicals with different radicands, so I can’t just simplify them easily. Maybe I can estimate their values or see if there's a way to compare them without calculating the exact decimal values.\n\nLet me write down the two expressions:\n\n1. sqrt(9) + sqrt(33) = 3 + sqrt(33)\n2. sqrt(15) + sqrt(24) = sqrt(15) + sqrt(24)\n\nI need to compare 3 + sqrt(33) and sqrt(15) + sqrt(24).

So, I want to find whether A - B is positive or negative.\n\nCalculating A - B: (3 + sqrt(33)) - (sqrt(15) + sqrt(24)) = 3 - sqrt(15) + sqrt(33) - sqrt(24)\n\nHmm, so I have 3 - sqrt(15) + sqrt(33) - sqrt(24). I need to figure out if this is positive or negative.\n\nMaybe I can group terms to make it easier: (3 - sqrt(15)) + (sqrt(33) - sqrt(24))\n\nLet me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, 3 - sqrt(15). I know that sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(15) is a bit less than 4. 3 is less than 4, so 3 - sqrt(15) is negative because sqrt(15) is more than 3. Let me approximate sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, so 3 - 3.872 ≈ -0.872.\n\nNext, sqrt(33) - sqrt(24). sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(24) is just a bit less than 5. Let me approximate sqrt(24) ≈ 4.899. Then sqrt(33) is a bit more than sqrt(25), so sqrt(33) ≈ 5.744. So, sqrt(33) - sqrt(24) ≈ 5.744 - 4.899 ≈ 0.845.\n\nNow, adding both results: (-0.872) + 0.845 ≈ -0.027.\n\nSo, the difference A - B is approximately -0.027, which is slightly negative. That means A is slightly less than B. Therefore, sqrt(15) + sqrt(24) is larger than 3 + sqrt(33).\n\nWait, let me make sure I did the calculations correctly because sometimes approximations can be misleading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions to compare them. Since both expressions are sums of square roots, squaring them might help.\n\nLet me denote A = 3 + sqrt(33) and B = sqrt(15) + sqrt(24).\n\nCompute A^2: (3 + sqrt(33))^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*sqrt(33) + (sqrt(33))^2 = 9 + 6*sqrt(33) + 33 = 42 + 6*sqrt(33)\n\nCompute B^2: (sqrt(15) + sqrt(24))^2 = (sqrt(15))^2 + 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(24) + (sqrt(24))^2 = 15 + 2*sqrt(360) + 24 = 39 + 2*sqrt(360)\n\nNow, I need to compare 42 + 6*sqrt(33) and 39 + 2*sqrt(360).\n\nLet me compute the approximate values:\n\nsqrt(33) ≈ 5.744, so 6*sqrt(33) ≈ 6*5.744 ≈ 34.464\n\nThus, A^2 ≈ 42 + 34.464 ≈ 76.464\n\nsqrt(360) is sqrt(36*10) = 6*sqrt(10) ≈ 6*3.162 ≈ 18.972\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(360) ≈ 2*18.972 ≈ 37.944\n\nThus, B^2 ≈ 39 + 37.944 ≈ 76.944\n\nSo, A^2 ≈ 76.464 and B^2 ≈ 76.944. Since 76.464 < 76.944, it means that A^2 < B^2, so A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(15) + sqrt(24) is larger than 3 + sqrt(33). So, the larger number is sqrt(15) + sqrt(24), which is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) with a = 15 and b = 24.\n\nI think this makes sense. Alternatively, if I consider the approximate decimal values:\n\nsqrt(33) ≈ 5.744, so 3 + 5.744 ≈ 8.744\n\nsqrt(15) ≈ 3.872 and sqrt(24) ≈ 4.899, so 3.872 + 4.899 ≈ 8.771\n\nSo, 8.771 is slightly larger than 8.744. That also confirms that sqrt(15) + sqrt(24) is larger.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(15) + sqrt(24), which is already in the required form.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{24}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{9} + \\sqrt{33}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{24}\\), we denote the expressions as follows:\n\n1. \\(A = 3 + \\sqrt{33}\\)\n2. \\(B = \\sqrt{15} + \\sqrt{24}\\)\n\nWe need to determine which one is larger.

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(41) and sqrt(10) + sqrt(11). Hmm, both of these are sums of square roots, so I guess I need to figure out whether one is larger than the other. I remember that when comparing square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help because it can eliminate the square roots. But I also remember that squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I have to be careful about that. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll denote the two expressions:\n\nLet A = sqrt(8) + sqrt(41)\n\nand B = sqrt(10) + sqrt(11)\n\nI need to compare A and B. So, one approach is to compute A^2 and B^2, since squaring should preserve the inequality if both A and B are positive, which they are since they are sums of positive square roots.\n\nCalculating A^2:\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(41))^2 = (sqrt(8))^2 + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))^2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(sqrt(8))^2 = 8\n\n(sqrt(41))^2 = 41\n\nThe middle term: 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(41) = 2*sqrt(8*41) = 2*sqrt(328)\n\nSo, A^2 = 8 + 41 + 2*sqrt(328) = 49 + 2*sqrt(328)\n\nCalculating B^2:\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(10) + sqrt(11))^2 = (sqrt(10))^2 + 2*sqrt(10)*sqrt(11) + (sqrt(11))^2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(sqrt(10))^2 = 10\n\n(sqrt(11))^2 = 11\n\nMiddle term: 2*sqrt(10*11) = 2*sqrt(110)\n\nSo, B^2 = 10 + 11 + 2*sqrt(110) = 21 + 2*sqrt(110)\n\nSo now, I have A^2 = 49 + 2*sqrt(328) and B^2 = 21 + 2*sqrt(110). I need to compare A and B, which are square roots of these quantities.\n\nBut since A and B are both positive, if A^2 > B^2, then A > B, and vice versa. So, let's compare 49 + 2*sqrt(328) and 21 + 2*sqrt(110).\n\nTo make this easier, maybe subtract the smaller from the larger. Let's compute A^2 - B^2:\n\nA^2 - B^2 = (49 + 2*sqrt(328)) - (21 + 2*sqrt(110)) = (49 - 21) + (2*sqrt(328) - 2*sqrt(110)) = 28 + 2*(sqrt(328) - sqrt(110))\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 = 28 + 2*(sqrt(328) - sqrt(110))\n\nNow, I need to see whether this is positive or negative. So, if sqrt(328) - sqrt(110) is positive, then the entire expression is positive. If it's negative, then the whole thing is 28 plus a negative number, which could be positive or negative depending on the magnitude.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(328) and sqrt(110) approximately.\n\nI know that 18^2 = 324, which is close to 328. So sqrt(328) is about 18 + (328 - 324)/(2*18) = 18 + 4/36 = 18 + 1/9 ≈ 18.111\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(110). I know that 10^2 = 100, 11^2 = 121, so sqrt(110) is between 10 and 11. Let me approximate it.\n\n10.5^2 = 110.25. That's very close to 110. So sqrt(110) ≈ 10.488 (since 10.488^2 = approx 110). Let me check:\n\n10.488^2 = (10 + 0.488)^2 = 10^2 + 2*10*0.488 + 0.488^2 = 100 + 9.76 + 0.238 ≈ 109.998, which is about 110. So, sqrt(110) ≈ 10.488.\n\nSo, sqrt(328) ≈ 18.111 and sqrt(110) ≈ 10.488.\n\nSo, sqrt(328) - sqrt(110) ≈ 18.111 - 10.488 ≈ 7.623.\n\nSo, sqrt(328) - sqrt(110) is approximately 7.623.\n\nTherefore, A^2 - B^2 = 28 + 2*7.623 ≈ 28 + 15.246 ≈ 43.246.\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 ≈ 43.246, which is positive. Therefore, A^2 > B^2, which implies that A > B.\n\nSo, sqrt(8) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(10) + sqrt(11).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, since I approximated sqrt(328) as 18.111 and sqrt(110) as 10.488, which might not be precise, but the difference was around 7.623, so when I multiply by 2, it's about 15.246, adding to 28 gives about 43.246, which is positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try another approach without approximating.\n\nLet me think about the difference sqrt(8) + sqrt(41) - sqrt(10) - sqrt(11). If this is positive, then A > B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this difference as (sqrt(8) - sqrt(10)) + (sqrt(41) - sqrt(11)).\n\nEach of these terms may be positive or negative. Let me compute sqrt(8) - sqrt(10):\n\nsqrt(8) ≈ 2.828, sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162, so sqrt(8) - sqrt(10) ≈ -0.334.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403, sqrt(11) ≈ 3.316, so sqrt(41) - sqrt(11) ≈ 3.087.\n\nSo, the total difference is approximately -0.334 + 3.087 ≈ 2.753, which is positive. So, A - B ≈ 2.753, which is positive.\n\nSo, that also suggests that A is larger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of convexity or concavity, but maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the function f(x) = sqrt(x) and see if it's concave or convex. Since the second derivative is negative, it's concave. Then, by Jensen's inequality, but I don't know if that helps here because we're dealing with a sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about how sqrt(8) is less than sqrt(10) and sqrt(41) is greater than sqrt(11), but the increase from sqrt(41) is more significant than the decrease from sqrt(8) relative to sqrt(10) and sqrt(11).\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to square A and B and compare, which we did, and we saw that A^2 is significantly larger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compare A and B by noting that sqrt(8) + sqrt(41) is between sqrt(8) + sqrt(41), but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that sqrt(10) + sqrt(11) is less than 2*sqrt(10.5) by the AM-QM inequality, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think about the difference between A and B, and maybe bound it between two squares.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(41) and sqrt(10) + sqrt(11) by considering their squares and then comparing.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier, so I think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the difference"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(20) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(33) + sqrt(39) or vice versa. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can calculate each square root separately and then add them up, but I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way. Alternatively, perhaps I can square both expressions to compare them directly. That might be easier because squaring is a straightforward operation and it removes the square roots, which can be tricky to handle otherwise.\n\nLet me denote the first expression as A = sqrt(20) + sqrt(41) and the second as B = sqrt(33) + sqrt(39). So, I need to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square both A and B, I get:\n\nA² = (sqrt(20) + sqrt(41))² = 20 + 41 + 2*sqrt(20*41) = 61 + 2*sqrt(820)\n\nSimilarly, B² = (sqrt(33) + sqrt(39))² = 33 + 39 + 2*sqrt(33*39) = 72 + 2*sqrt(1287)\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B². Since sqrt(820) and sqrt(1287) are both positive, I can see which sum is larger.\n\nLet me compute the approximate values of sqrt(820) and sqrt(1287). \n\nFirst, sqrt(820): 28² is 784, and 29² is 841. So sqrt(820) is between 28 and 29. Let's see how close. 28.9² = (28 + 0.9)² = 28² + 2*28*0.9 + 0.9² = 784 + 50.4 + 0.81 = 835.21. Hmm, that's already above 820. Wait, perhaps I should start with 28.9² = 835.21, which is too high. Maybe 28.9 is too much. Let me try 28.7²: 28.7² = (28 + 0.7)² = 28² + 2*28*0.7 + 0.7² = 784 + 39.2 + 0.49 = 823.69. Close to 820. So 28.7² = 823.69, which is 3.69 more than 820. So sqrt(820) is approximately 28.7 minus a little. Let's see, 28.7 - x, where (28.7 - x)² ≈ 820.\n\nApproximate using linear approximation: derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2*sqrt(x)), so sqrt(820) ≈ 28.7 - (820 - 823.69)/(2*28.7). So that's 28.7 - (-3.69)/(57.4) ≈ 28.7 + 0.064 ≈ 28.764.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1287): Let's find a number between 35 and 36, since 35² = 1225 and 36² = 1296. So sqrt(1287) is approximately 35 + (1287 - 1225)/(2*35) = 35 + 62/70 ≈ 35 + 0.8857 ≈ 35.8857. Let me check 35.8857²: 35² + 2*35*0.8857 + (0.8857)² ≈ 1225 + 61.999 + 0.784 ≈ 1287.784, which is a bit over. So maybe 35.8857 is a bit high. Let's try 35.88:\n\n35.88²: 35² + 2*35*0.88 + 0.88² = 1225 + 61.6 + 0.7744 ≈ 1287.3744. That's very close. So sqrt(1287) is approximately 35.88.\n\nSo, sqrt(820) is approximately 28.764 and sqrt(1287) is approximately 35.88.\n\nNow, let me compute A² and B²:\n\nA² = 61 + 2*28.764 ≈ 61 + 57.528 ≈ 118.528\n\nB² = 72 + 2*35.88 ≈ 72 + 71.76 ≈ 143.76\n\nSo, B² is approximately 143.76, which is greater than A², which is approximately 118.528. Therefore, B > A.\n\nSo, sqrt(33) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(20) + sqrt(41). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(33) + sqrt(39), which is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), where a = 33 and b = 39.\n\nI can double-check my calculations because the approximations might have introduced some errors, but the conclusion seems consistent. Let me verify the approximations:\n\nsqrt(820): 28.7² is 823.69, which is more than 820, so sqrt(820) is less than 28.7, which we approximated as 28.764. So, 2*sqrt(820) ≈ 57.528. So, A² = 61 + 57.528 ≈ 118.528.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1287): 35.88² is 1287.3744, which is slightly more, so sqrt(1287) is approximately 35.88. Then, 2*sqrt(1287) ≈ 71.76, so B² = 72 + 71.76 ≈ 143.76.\n\nYes, so definitely B² > A², so B > A.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compare sqrt(20) + sqrt(41) and sqrt(33) + sqrt(39) is to consider whether adding sqrt(20) and sqrt(41) is more than adding sqrt(33) and sqrt(39). Since sqrt(33) and sqrt(39) are both larger than sqrt(20) and sqrt(41), but I think that might not necessarily be the case because the sum could be larger or smaller depending on the relative sizes.\n\nWait, no. Actually, sqrt(33) is between sqrt(25) = 5 and sqrt(36) = 6. Similarly, sqrt(39) is between 6 and 7 because sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7. Similarly, sqrt(20) is between 4 and 5 because sqrt(16) is 4 and sqrt(25) is 5. sqrt(41) is between 6 and 7 because sqrt(36) is 6 and sqrt(49) is 7.\n\nSo, both sqrt(20) and sqrt(41) are around 4.5, and sqrt(33) and sqrt(39) are around 5.7 and 6.25, respectively. So, adding sqrt(33) + sqrt(39) gives roughly 5.7 + 6.25 = 11.95, while sqrt(20) + sqrt(41) is roughly 4.5 + 6.4 = 10.9. So, 11.95 is greater than 10.9, confirming that B > A.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to square both expressions and see which is larger. As I did earlier, which gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that sqrt(33) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(20) + sqrt(41).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{33} + \\sqrt{39}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{41}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{33} + \\sqrt{39}\\), we can square both expressions and compare the results.\n\nLet \\(A = \\sqrt{20}"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(3) + sqrt(40) and sqrt(38) + sqrt(39), and figure out which one is larger. Then, I have to write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can help because it can make the expressions easier to handle. But I also need to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extra solutions or make things more complicated. So, I have to be cautious here.\n\nLet me denote:\nA = sqrt(3) + sqrt(40)\nB = sqrt(38) + sqrt(39)\n\nI need to determine whether A is greater than B or vice versa.\n\nIf I square both A and B, I can compare them without dealing with the square roots directly. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with A:\nA² = (sqrt(3) + sqrt(40))²\n= (sqrt(3))² + 2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(40) + (sqrt(40))²\n= 3 + 2*sqrt(120) + 40\n= 43 + 2*sqrt(120)\n\nSimilarly, for B:\nB² = (sqrt(38) + sqrt(39))²\n= (sqrt(38))² + 2*sqrt(38)*sqrt(39) + (sqrt(39))²\n= 38 + 2*sqrt(1482) + 39\n= 77 + 2*sqrt(1482)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check the calculation for B. The product inside the square root for the cross term is sqrt(38)*sqrt(39). So, 38*39 is 1482, so sqrt(1482). That seems correct.\n\nSo now, I have:\nA² = 43 + 2*sqrt(120)\nB² = 77 + 2*sqrt(1482)\n\nHmm, okay, so comparing A² and B². Which is larger?\n\nWell, 77 is definitely larger than 43, so even if we subtract 43 from both, B² is larger by 34. But wait, that can't be right because sqrt(1482) is a large number, so 2*sqrt(1482) will be significantly larger than 2*sqrt(120). So, actually, B² is more than A² because 77 + something is larger than 43 + something else.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is this correct? Because 2*sqrt(1482) is way bigger than 2*sqrt(120). So, 77 + something huge is definitely bigger than 43 + something small. So, that suggests that B² > A², which would mean that B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(38) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(3) + sqrt(40). So, the larger number is sqrt(38) + sqrt(39).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. So, A² is 43 + 2*sqrt(120). Let me compute sqrt(120). sqrt(120) is approximately 10.954. So, 2*sqrt(120) is about 21.908.\n\nSo, A² ≈ 43 + 21.908 ≈ 64.908.\n\nSimilarly, B² is 77 + 2*sqrt(1482). Let me compute sqrt(1482). Hmm, 38² is 1444, so sqrt(1482) is a bit more than 38. Let me compute 38 squared is 1444, so 38.5 squared is (38 + 0.5)^2 = 38² + 2*38*0.5 + 0.5² = 1444 + 38 + 0.25 = 1482.25. Oh, interesting! So, sqrt(1482) is just a tiny bit less than 38.5, approximately 38.496.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(1482) is approximately 2*38.496 ≈ 76.992.\n\nSo, B² ≈ 77 + 76.992 ≈ 153.992.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be. If A² is about 64.908 and B² is about 153.992, then B² is much larger. So, that would imply that B > A. So, sqrt(38) + sqrt(39) is larger. So, my initial conclusion was correct.\n\nBut why did I think 2*sqrt(1482) is way larger than 2*sqrt(120)? Because 120 is 40*3, and 1482 is 38*39, which is close to 38.5 squared. So, the cross terms are much larger for B.\n\nTherefore, in conclusion, B is larger than A. So, sqrt(38) + sqrt(39) is larger.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can compare the two sums without squaring.\n\nSo, A = sqrt(3) + sqrt(40), B = sqrt(38) + sqrt(39). I can compute the difference B - A and see if it's positive or negative.\n\nCompute B - A = sqrt(38) - sqrt(3) + sqrt(39) - sqrt(40).\n\nNow, can I compute each pair?\n\nFirst, sqrt(38) - sqrt(3). Let's approximate these.\n\nsqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(38) ≈ 6.164, so sqrt(38) - sqrt(3) ≈ 6.164 - 1.732 ≈ 4.432.\n\nNext, sqrt(39) - sqrt(40). Let's approximate.\n\nsqrt(39) ≈ 6.245, sqrt(40) ≈ 6.325, so sqrt(39) - sqrt(40) ≈ 6.245 - 6.325 ≈ -0.08.\n\nSo, adding these two differences:\n\n4.432 - 0.08 ≈ 4.352.\n\nTherefore, B - A ≈ 4.352, which is positive. So, B is larger than A.\n\nHmm, okay, that also gives me the same result as before. So, seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another method: Maybe using the concept of the function f(x) = sqrt(x), and seeing how the sums behave.\n\nBut perhaps another way, considering that sqrt(x) is concave, so the function lies above the line connecting two points. Wait, that might be a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, think about the differences between the terms.\n\nWait, let's consider that sqrt(38) is just a bit less than sqrt(39), and sqrt(39) is less than sqrt(40). So, perhaps the difference between sqrt(38) and sqrt(3) is larger than the difference between sqrt(40) and sqrt(39). Hmm, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the individual terms:\n\nsqrt(38) + sqrt(39) is more than sqrt(38) + sqrt(38), which is 2*sqrt(38). Similarly, sqrt(3) + sqrt(40) is less than 2*sqrt(40). So, maybe 2*sqrt(38) is less than sqrt(3) + sqrt(40). But wait, that might not be directly comparable.\n\nWait, let's compute 2*sqrt(38). sqrt(38) ≈ 6.164, so 2*sqrt(38) ≈ 12.328.\n\nAnd sqrt(3) + sqrt(40) ≈ 1.732 + 6.325 ≈ 8.057.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(38) is about 12.328, and sqrt(3) + sqrt(40) is about 8.057, so 12.328 > 8.057, so 2*sqrt(38) > sqrt(3) + sqrt(40). Similarly, 2*sqrt(39) ≈ 12.490, and sqrt(38) + sqrt(39) ≈ 6.164 + 6.245 ≈ 12.409. So, 2*sqrt(39) ≈ 12.490 > 1"

Since 2 is positive, the sign of the entire expression depends on the term inside the parentheses: 3 + sqrt(130) - sqrt(30).\n\nLet me compute the approximate values of sqrt(130) and sqrt(30) to see if I can estimate this.\n\nsqrt(9) = 3, sqrt(16) = 4, so sqrt(130) is somewhere between 11 and 12 because 11^2 = 121 and 12^2 = 144. Let me compute 11.4^2: 11.4*11.4 = 129.96, which is almost 130. So sqrt(130) ≈ 11.401.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(30): sqrt(25)=5, sqrt(36)=6, so sqrt(30) is between 5 and 6. Let's compute 5.47^2: 5.47*5.47 ≈ 29.9209, which is almost 30. So sqrt(30) ≈ 5.477.\n\nSo, substituting these approximations:\n\n3 + sqrt(130) - sqrt(30) ≈ 3 + 11.401 - 5.477 ≈ 3 + 11.401 = 14.401 - 5.477 ≈ 8.924\n\nSo, the term inside the parentheses is approximately 8.924, which is positive. Therefore, B^2 - A^2 ≈ 2*8.924 ≈ 17.848, which is definitely positive. Hence, B^2 > A^2.\n\nSince squaring is a monotonically increasing function for non-negative numbers, this implies that B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(10) + sqrt(13) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(15).

And then, once I figure out which one is larger, I have to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that comparing the sizes of square roots can sometimes be tricky because they aren't linear. That is, adding two square roots doesn't just work the same way as adding two numbers. So, I can't just compare the numbers inside the roots or anything like that. I need another strategy.\n\nMaybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare? That could work because both expressions are sums of square roots, and squaring them might turn the addition into something more manageable. Let me try that.\n\nLet's denote:\n\nA = sqrt(11) + sqrt(32)\n\nB = sqrt(27) + sqrt(31)\n\nI need to compare A and B. Let me square both A and B.\n\nSo, A² = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(32))² = (sqrt(11))² + 2*sqrt(11)*sqrt(32) + (sqrt(32))²\n\nSimplify that:\n\nA² = 11 + 2*sqrt(11*32) + 32\n\nSimilarly, B² = (sqrt(27) + sqrt(31))² = (sqrt(27))² + 2*sqrt(27)*sqrt(31) + (sqrt(31))²\n\nSimplify that:\n\nB² = 27 + 2*sqrt(27*31) + 31\n\nAlright, so now I can compute the numerical values of A² and B² to see which one is larger.\n\nStarting with A²:\n\n11 + 32 = 43. Now, the middle term is 2*sqrt(11*32). Let me compute 11*32 first.\n\n11*32 = 352, so sqrt(352). Hmm, sqrt(352) can be simplified.\n\nLet me see, 352 divided by 16 is 22, so sqrt(352) = sqrt(16*22) = 4*sqrt(22). Therefore, 2*sqrt(352) = 2*4*sqrt(22) = 8*sqrt(22).\n\nSo, A² = 43 + 8*sqrt(22). Now, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.690, so 8*sqrt(22) is approximately 8*4.690 = 37.52.\n\nAdding that to 43 gives A² ≈ 43 + 37.52 = 80.52.\n\nOkay, now let's compute B²:\n\n27 + 31 = 58. Middle term is 2*sqrt(27*31). Let me compute 27*31 first.\n\n27*31 = 837, so sqrt(837). Hmm, let's see. 29^2 is 841, so sqrt(837) is just a bit less than 29. Let me approximate it.\n\n29^2 = 841, so 29^2 - 837 = 4. So, sqrt(837) = sqrt(841 - 4) ≈ 29 - (4)/(2*29) using the binomial approximation, which is approximately 29 - 4/58 ≈ 29 - 0.069 ≈ 28.931.\n\nHence, 2*sqrt(837) ≈ 2*28.931 ≈ 57.862.\n\nTherefore, B² ≈ 58 + 57.862 ≈ 115.862.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. Because 27 + 31 is 58, and 2*sqrt(837) is about 57.862, so adding those together gives around 115.862. But that seems too high? Hmm, maybe my approximation for sqrt(837) is a bit off.\n\nWait, let me check sqrt(837) again. Let me compute 29^2=841, so 29^2=841, so 841 - 837=4. So, sqrt(837)=sqrt(29^2 - 4). To approximate sqrt(29^2 - 4), we can use the formula sqrt(a^2 - b) ≈ a - b/(2a) for small b.\n\nSo, sqrt(29^2 - 4)=29 - 4/(2*29)=29 - 2/29≈29 - 0.069≈28.931. So, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(837)=57.862, so 58 + 57.862≈115.862. So, B²≈115.862.\n\nWait, but earlier, for A², I had A²≈80.52. So, B² is larger than A², which would mean that B is larger than A. So, sqrt(27) + sqrt(31) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(32). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(27) + sqrt(31), which should be written in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, the answer would be sqrt(27) + sqrt(31).\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can mislead.\n\nLet me compute A² and B² more accurately.\n\nStarting with A²:\n\nA² = (sqrt(11) + sqrt(32))² = 11 + 32 + 2*sqrt(11*32) = 43 + 2*sqrt(352).\n\nWe can compute sqrt(352). Let's see, 352 divided by 16 is 22, so sqrt(352) is 4*sqrt(22). Now, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.690, so 4*sqrt(22) is approximately 18.760. Therefore, 2*sqrt(352)=2*18.760≈37.520.\n\nSo, A² is 43 + 37.520=80.520.\n\nSimilarly, for B²:\n\nB² = (sqrt(27) + sqrt(31))² =27 + 31 + 2*sqrt(27*31)=58 + 2*sqrt(837).\n\nWe need to compute sqrt(837). Let me find a better approximation.\n\nWe know that 29^2=841, so sqrt(837)=sqrt(841-4)=sqrt(841 - 2^2). So, using the same formula as before: sqrt(a^2 - b)≈a - b/(2a). So, sqrt(841 - 4)=29 - 4/(2*29)=29 - 2/29≈29 - 0.069≈28.931.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(837)=2*28.931≈57.862.\n\nHence, B²≈58 +57.862=115.862.\n\nSo, A²≈80.52 and B²≈115.86. Therefore, B² is indeed larger than A², so B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(27) + sqrt(31) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(32). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(27) + sqrt(31), which is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, the answer is sqrt(27) + sqrt(31).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. Is this conclusion correct? Maybe it's better to compute A and B numerically instead of squaring them to see which is larger.\n\nBecause sometimes when you square numbers, the approximations can be misleading, especially if the numbers are close to each other.\n\nSo, let me compute A and B numerically.\n\nCompute A = sqrt(11) + sqrt(32).\n\nsqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166.\n\nsqrt(32)≈5.6568.\n\nSo, A≈3.3166 + 5.6568≈8.9734.\n\nCompute B = sqrt(27) + sqrt(31).\n\nsqrt(27)≈5.1962.\n\nsqrt(31)≈5."

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to figure out whether sqrt(6) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(22) + sqrt(40), or vice versa. Then, whichever one is bigger, I have to write it in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I know that when comparing sums of square roots, sometimes squaring both sides can be helpful because it simplifies things. But I also remember that squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I have to be careful if I end up with solutions that don't actually satisfy the original equation. Hmm, maybe I should just try squaring both expressions and see which one is bigger, that might be straightforward.\n\nLet me denote A as sqrt(6) + sqrt(41) and B as sqrt(22) + sqrt(40). So, I need to compare A and B. I'll start by squaring A and B.\n\nCalculating A squared: (sqrt(6) + sqrt(41))². Using the formula (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y², so that becomes 6 + 2*sqrt(6*41) + 41. Let me compute that: 6 + 41 is 47, so A² = 47 + 2*sqrt(246). Because 6*41 is 246.\n\nNow, calculating B squared: (sqrt(22) + sqrt(40))². Again, using the same formula, that's 22 + 2*sqrt(22*40) + 40. So, 22 + 40 is 62, so B² = 62 + 2*sqrt(880). Because 22*40 is 880.\n\nSo now, I have A² = 47 + 2*sqrt(246) and B² = 62 + 2*sqrt(880). To compare A and B, I can compare A² and B² because if A² > B², then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values of these square roots to see which is bigger. Let's start with sqrt(246) and sqrt(880).\n\nCalculating sqrt(246): Well, 15² is 225, 16² is 256, so sqrt(246) is between 15 and 16. Let me see, 15.7² is 15.7*15.7. Let me compute that: 15² is 225, 0.7² is 0.49, and 2*15*0.7 is 21. So, 225 + 21 + 0.49 is 246.49. Wait, that's interesting. So 15.7² is 246.49, which is just a bit over 246. So, sqrt(246) is approximately 15.7 minus a tiny bit. Let me note that sqrt(246) ≈ 15.7 - ε, where ε is a small positive number.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(880): Let's figure that out. 29² is 841, 30² is 900. So, sqrt(880) is between 29 and 30. Let's compute 29.6²: 29² is 841, 0.6² is 0.36, and 2*29*0.6 is 34.8. So, adding up: 841 + 34.8 + 0.36 is 876.16. Hmm, that's still less than 880. Next, 29.7²: 29.7² is (29 + 0.7)² = 29² + 2*29*0.7 + 0.7² = 841 + 40.6 + 0.49 = 882.09. Oh, okay, so 29.7² is 882.09, which is just over 880. Therefore, sqrt(880) is between 29.6 and 29.7.\n\nLet me compute 29.6²: as above, 29.6² is 876.16. The difference between 880 and 876.16 is 3.84. So, each 0.1 increase in the square root leads to an increase in the square of approximately 2*29.6*0.1 + 0.1² = 5.92 + 0.01 = 5.93. So, to cover 3.84, we need approximately 3.84 / 5.93 ≈ 0.646. So, sqrt(880) ≈ 29.6 + 0.646 ≈ 29.6 + 0.646 ≈ 29.6 + 0.646, so approximately 29.6 + 0.646 is 29.6 + 0.6 + 0.046 = 29.6 + 0.6 is 30.2, plus 0.046 is 29.646. So, sqrt(880) ≈ 29.646.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. If 29.6² is 876.16, then 29.64²: let me compute that.\n\n29.64²: Let's break it down as (29.6 + 0.04)² = 29.6² + 2*29.6*0.04 + 0.04² = 876.16 + 2*(1.184) + 0.0016 = 876.16 + 2.368 + 0.0016 ≈ 876.16 + 2.3696 ≈ 878.5296.\n\nWait, that's still less than 880. Hmm, so 29.64² is about 878.53, which is still short by 1.47.\n\nLet me compute 29.64 + 0.01 = 29.65.\n\n29.65²: 29.64² + 2*29.64*0.01 + 0.01² ≈ 878.5296 + 0.5928 + 0.0001 ≈ 878.5296 + 0.5929 ≈ 879.1225.\n\nStill below 880.\n\nNext, 29.65 + 0.005 = 29.655.\n\n29.655²: Let's compute that as 29.65² + 2*29.65*0.005 + 0.005² ≈ 878.5296 + 0.2965 + 0.000025 ≈ 878.5296 + 0.2965 ≈ 878.8261.\n\nStill missing 1.1739.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can just use the linear approximation.\n\nWe know that f(x) = x², and we want to find x such that f(x) = 880, given that f(29.6) = 876.16 and f(29.64) ≈ 878.53.\n\nSo, the difference between 29.6 and 29.64 is 0.04, and f(29.6) = 876.16, f(29.64) ≈ 878.53.\n\nSo, the change in f is 878.53 - 876.16 = 2.37 over an interval of 0.04 in x.\n\nWe need to find the x such that f(x) = 880. The difference from 876.16 is 880 - 876.16 = 3.84.\n\nSo, the fraction is 3.84 / 2.37 ≈ 1.616. So, approximately 1.616 of the 0.04 interval.\n\nSo, x ≈ 29.6 + 1.616*0.04 ≈ 29.6 + 0.06464"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(9) + sqrt(40) and sqrt(11) + sqrt(30). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(9) + sqrt(40) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) or vice versa. Hmm, let me see. Maybe I can compute both values numerically to compare them? That sounds straightforward, but I wonder if there's a smarter way to do this without crunching too many numbers.\n\nFirst, let me recall that sqrt(9) is 3, since 3 squared is 9. Similarly, sqrt(40) is a bit trickier. I know that 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(40) must be somewhere between 6 and 7. Maybe I can approximate it. Let's see, 6.3 squared is 39.69, which is pretty close to 40. So sqrt(40) is approximately 6.3245. \n\nSo, sqrt(9) + sqrt(40) is 3 + 6.3245, which equals approximately 9.3245.\n\nNow, let's do the same for sqrt(11) + sqrt(30). I know that 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16, so sqrt(11) is between 3 and 4. Let me approximate it. 3.3 squared is 10.89, which is less than 11. 3.4 squared is 11.56, which is a bit more than 11. So sqrt(11) is approximately 3.3166. \n\nSimilarly, sqrt(30) is between 5 and 6 because 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36. Let me see, 5.4 squared is 29.16, which is just below 30. 5.5 squared is 30.25, which is just above 30. So sqrt(30) is approximately 5.4772.\n\nSo, sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) is approximately 3.3166 + 5.4772, which is roughly 8.7938.\n\nComparing the two results: 9.3245 vs. 8.7938. Clearly, 9.3245 is larger. So, sqrt(9) + sqrt(40) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(30).\n\nWait, but let me double-check my approximations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I approximated sqrt(40) as 6.3245, and sqrt(11) as 3.3166, and sqrt(30) as 5.4772. Let me verify these calculations.\n\nStarting with sqrt(40). 6.3 squared is 39.69, which is just 0.31 less than 40. So, 6.3 squared is 39.69, so 6.3 + x squared equals 40. Let me use the linear approximation for sqrt near 6.3. The derivative of sqrt(x) is 1/(2 sqrt(x)). So, at x=6.3, the derivative is 1/(2*6.3) ≈ 1/12.6 ≈ 0.0794. Therefore, sqrt(6.3 + delta) ≈ sqrt(6.3) + delta * 0.0794. \n\nSince 6.3 squared is 39.69, and we need 39.69 + 0.31, so delta is 0.31. Therefore, sqrt(40) ≈ sqrt(6.3) + 0.31 * 0.0794 ≈ 6.3 + 0.0246 ≈ 6.3246, which matches my initial approximation of 6.3245. So that seems correct.\n\nNow, sqrt(11). I know that 3.3 squared is 10.89, which is 0.11 less than 11. So, using the derivative again, the derivative at x=3.3 is 1/(2*3.3) ≈ 1/6.6 ≈ 0.1515. So, sqrt(11) ≈ sqrt(3.3) + 0.11 * 0.1515 ≈ 3.3 + 0.0167 ≈ 3.3167, which is also consistent with my approximation of 3.3166. \n\nSimilarly, sqrt(30). 5.5 squared is 30.25, which is 0.25 above 30. So, using the derivative at x=5.5. The derivative is 1/(2*5.5) = 1/11 ≈ 0.0909. So, sqrt(30) ≈ sqrt(5.5) + 0.25 * 0.0909 ≈ 5.5 + 0.0227 ≈ 5.5227. Wait, this is different from my initial approximation of 5.4772. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's see. 5.4 squared is 29.16, which is 0.84 below 30. 5.5 squared is 30.25, which is 0.25 above 30. So, sqrt(30) is somewhere between 5.4 and 5.5. Let's use linear approximation.\n\nLet f(x) = sqrt(x). We know f(5.4) = 5.4^(1/2) ≈ 2.3484, but wait, that can't be right because 5.4 squared is 29.16, so sqrt(5.4) is approximately 2.3484? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, sqrt(5.4) is approximately 2.3238, right? Because 2.3238 squared is approximately 5.4. Similarly, sqrt(30) is approximately 5.4772, as I initially thought.\n\nWait, so maybe my linear approximation was the wrong approach here. Let me try another method. Let me use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate sqrt(30). \n\nWe can use the iteration formula: x_{n+1} = (x_n + 30/x_n)/2. Let's start with an initial guess of x0 = 5.5.\n\nSo, x1 = (5.5 + 30/5.5)/2 = (5.5 + 5.4545)/2 ≈ (10.9545)/2 ≈ 5.4772. So, that gives us sqrt(30) ≈ 5.4772 after one iteration. That's consistent with my initial approximation.\n\nSo, my initial linear approximation was incorrect because I misapplied the derivative. The correct way is to use the Newton-Raphson method, which converges faster. So, sqrt(30) is indeed approximately 5.4772.\n\nTherefore, my calculations for sqrt(11) and sqrt(30) are correct. So, going back, sqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166 and sqrt(30) ≈ 5.4772, so their sum is approximately 8.7938.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(9) is 3, and sqrt(40) ≈ 6.3245, so their sum is 9.3245.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(9) + sqrt(40) is approximately 9.3245, which is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(30) ≈ 8.7938.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me verify these approximations another way. Maybe by squaring both sums and comparing.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(9) + sqrt(40) = 3 + sqrt(40), and B = sqrt(11) + sqrt(30).\n\nCompute A squared: (3 + sqrt(40))^2 = 9 + 6 sqrt(40) + 40 = 49 + 6 sqrt(40).\n\nCompute B squared: (sqrt(11) + sqrt(30))^2 = 11 + 2 sqrt(11*30) + 30 = 41 + 2 sqrt(330).\n\nNow, let's compute A squared minus B squared: (49 + 6 sqrt(40)) - (41 + 2 sqrt(330)) = 8 + 6 sqrt(40) - 2 sqrt(330).\n\nSo, if A squared is greater than B squared, then A is greater than B. So, let's see if 8 + 6 sqrt(40) - 2 sqrt(330) is positive.\n\nCompute 6 sqrt(40): sqrt(40"

I remember that sometimes when you have square roots, you can simplify them or find some patterns to compare them more easily.

But that might not be the most efficient way, especially since these numbers aren't perfect squares. However, I can try to approximate their values to get a sense of which sum is larger.\n\nStarting with sqrt(12). I know that sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(12) should be somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me see, 3 squared is 9, 3.5 squared is 12.25. Oh, so sqrt(12) is approximately 3.464 because 3.464 squared is 12. Similarly, sqrt(40). Hmm, sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(40) is between 6 and 7. Let me calculate it: 6.3 squared is 39.69, which is pretty close to 40, so sqrt(40) is approximately 6.324.\n\nSo, sqrt(12) + sqrt(40) is roughly 3.464 + 6.324. Let me add those up: 3.464 + 6.324 is 9.788.\n\nNow, let's do the same for sqrt(20) + sqrt(37). Starting with sqrt(20). I know sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(20) is between 4 and 5. Let me calculate it: 4.4 squared is 19.36, which is just under 20, so sqrt(20) is approximately 4.472.\n\nNext, sqrt(37). Hmm, sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(37) should be just a little more than 6. Let me calculate: 6.08 squared is 37. So, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.082.\n\nAdding them together: 4.472 + 6.082 is 10.554.\n\nWait a second, so sqrt(12) + sqrt(40) is approximately 9.788 and sqrt(20) + sqrt(37) is approximately 10.554. So, it seems like sqrt(20) + sqrt(37) is larger. But, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my approximations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both sums to see which one is larger without dealing with the square roots. That might be more accurate.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(12) + sqrt(40) and B = sqrt(20) + sqrt(37). I want to compare A and B.\n\nIf I square A, I get A² = (sqrt(12) + sqrt(40))² = 12 + 2*sqrt(12*40) + 40 = 52 + 2*sqrt(480). Similarly, squaring B, I get B² = (sqrt(20) + sqrt(37))² = 20 + 2*sqrt(20*37) + 37 = 57 + 2*sqrt(740).\n\nNow, comparing A² and B² is equivalent to comparing 52 + 2*sqrt(480) and 57 + 2*sqrt(740). Let me compute the difference: B² - A² = (57 + 2*sqrt(740)) - (52 + 2*sqrt(480)) = 5 + 2*(sqrt(740) - sqrt(480)).\n\nSo, if I can figure out whether sqrt(740) - sqrt(480) is positive or negative, I can determine whether B² is larger or smaller than A².\n\nWe know that sqrt(740) is larger than sqrt(480) because 740 > 480. Therefore, sqrt(740) - sqrt(480) is positive, which means that 2*(sqrt(740) - sqrt(480)) is positive. Thus, B² - A² = 5 + positive, which is definitely positive. Therefore, B² > A², so B > A. So, sqrt(20) + sqrt(37) is larger than sqrt(12) + sqrt(40).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the approximate decimal values more accurately.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(12) more precisely. I know 3.464² = 12. But let's compute it:\n\n3.464² = 3² + 2*3*0.464 + 0.464² = 9 + 2.784 + 0.215 = approximately 11.999, which is close to 12. So, sqrt(12) is approximately 3.4641.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(40). Let's compute 6.324²:\n\n6² = 36\n\n0.324² = 0.104\n\n2*6*0.324 = 3.888\n\nSo, total is 36 + 3.888 + 0.104 = approximately 40. So, 6.324² = approximately 40. So, sqrt(40) is approximately 6.32456.\n\nThus, sqrt(12) + sqrt(40) is approximately 3.4641 + 6.32456 = 9.78866.\n\nNow, sqrt(20). Let me compute this more accurately. I think sqrt(20) is approximately 4.4721.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n4.4721² = (4 + 0.4721)² = 16 + 2*4*0.4721 + 0.4721² = 16 + 3.7768 + 0.2229 ≈ 19.9997, which is approximately 20. So, sqrt(20) is approximately 4.47214.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(37). Let me compute sqrt(37):\n\n6² = 36, so sqrt(37) is just a bit more than 6. Let me calculate 6.08²:\n\n6.08² = 6² + 2*6*0.08 + 0.08² = 36 + 0.96 + 0.0064 = 36.9664.\n\nHmm, that's too low. Let's try 6.1²: 6.1² = 37.21, which is a bit higher than 37. So, sqrt(37) is between 6.08 and 6.1.\n\nCompute 6.08² = 36.9664\n\n6.09² = 6.09*6.09: Let's compute 6*6 = 36, 6*0.09 = 0.54, 0.09*6 = 0.54, 0.09*0.09 = 0.0081.

The interval between 4.1 and 4.2 is 0.1, so 0.19 over 0.1 is 1.9, which means sqrt(17) is approximately 4.1 + 0.19*(0.1) = 4.1 + 0.019 = 4.119. Hmm, so maybe around 4.12.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a better approximation method. Let me use linear approximation. Let’s let x = 17, and f(x) = sqrt(x). We know f(16) = 4, and f(25) = 5. The derivative of f(x) is (1/(2*sqrt(x))). So, f'(16) = 1/(2*4) = 1/8 = 0.125. Therefore, a linear approximation around x=16: f(17) ≈ f(16) + f'(16)*(17 - 16) = 4 + 0.125*(1) = 4.125. So, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.125.\n\nSimilarly, for sqrt(32). Since 5 squared is 25, 6 squared is 36. So, sqrt(32) is between 5 and 6. Let's approximate it. 5.6 squared is 31.36, which is just a bit less than 32. 5.7 squared is 32.49, which is a bit more than 32. So, sqrt(32) is between 5.6 and 5.7.\n\nUsing linear approximation again: Let x = 32, f(x) = sqrt(x). f(25) = 5, f(36) = 6. f'(25) = 1/(2*5) = 1/10 = 0.1. So, f(32) ≈ f(25) + f'(25)*(32 - 25) = 5 + 0.1*(7) = 5 + 0.7 = 5.7. So, sqrt(32) is approximately 5.7.\n\nBut wait, 5.7 squared is 32.49, which is more than 32. So, actually, sqrt(32) is a bit less than 5.7. Maybe 5.68?\n\nLet me check 5.68 squared: 5.68 * 5.68. Let's compute 5 * 5.68 = 28.4, and 0.68 * 5.68. 0.6 * 5.68 = 3.408, and 0.08 * 5.68 = 0.4544. So, 3.408 + 0.4544 = 3.8624. Therefore, 5.68 * 5.68 = 28.4 + 3.8624 = 32.2624. Hmm, still less than 32. So, maybe 5.69 squared: 5.69 * 5.69.\n\nCompute 5 * 5.69 = 28.45, and 0.69 * 5.69. 0.6 * 5.69 = 3.414, and 0.09 * 5.69 = 0.5121. So, 3.414 + 0.5121 = 3.9261. Therefore, 5.69 squared is 28.45 + 3.9261 = 32.3761, still a bit more than 32. So, sqrt(32) is between 5.68 and 5.69.\n\nLet me try 5.685 squared. 5.685 * 5.685. Let's compute 5 * 5.685 = 28.425, and 0.685 * 5.685. Let's compute 0.6 * 5.685 = 3.411, 0.08 * 5.685 = 0.4548, and 0.005 * 5.685 = 0.028425. Adding those up: 3.411 + 0.4548 = 3.8658 + 0.028425 = 3.894225. So, total is 28.425 + 3.894225 = 32.319225. Hmm, still a bit more than 32. So, sqrt(32) is approximately 5.68.\n\nWait, maybe I can do a better approximation. Let's take 5.685 squared is 32.319225, and 5.68 squared is 32.3761? Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Let me compute 5.68 squared again.\n\n5.68 * 5.68:\n\nFirst, 5 * 5 = 25.\n\n5 * 0.68 = 3.4\n\n0.68 * 5 = 3.4\n\n0.68 * 0.68 = 0.4624\n\nSo, adding up: 25 + 3.4 + 3.4 + 0.4624 = 25 + 6.8 + 0.4624 = 32.2624. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 5.68 squared is 32.2624, and 5.69 squared is 32.3761. So, sqrt(32) is approximately between 5.68 and 5.69.\n\nLet me compute 5.68 + (32 - 32.2624)/(32.3761 - 32.2624). So, the difference is 32 - 32.2624 = -0.2624, and the interval is 32.3761 - 32.2624 = 0.1137.\n\nSo, the fraction is -0.2624 / 0.1137 ≈ -2.3. So, approximately 5.68 - 2.3*(0.01) ≈ 5.68 - 0.023 ≈ 5.657. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 5.68 is higher than sqrt(32). Hmm, maybe I did the formula wrong.\n\nWait, actually, the linear approximation formula is f(x + h) ≈ f(x) + h*f'(x). Here, x = 25, f(x) = 5, h = 32 - 25 = 7. So, f(32) ≈ 5 + 7*(1/(2*5)) = 5 + 7*(0.1) = 5 + 0.7 = 5.7, which is correct. But since 32 is just a bit more than 25, the sqrt(32) is just a bit more than 5. So, perhaps my approximation is not good here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a better method. Let me try to compute sqrt(32) as a continued fraction or use a better iterative method"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(4) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(6) + sqrt(32). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to compare sqrt(4) + sqrt(49) and sqrt(6) + sqrt(32). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I should calculate each square root separately and then add them up? That seems straightforward.\n\nStarting with sqrt(4). I remember that sqrt(4) is 2 because 2 multiplied by 2 is 4. So that part is easy. Now, moving on to sqrt(49). Similarly, sqrt(49) should be 7 because 7 multiplied by 7 is 49. So adding those together, sqrt(4) + sqrt(49) is 2 + 7, which is 9.\n\nAlright, so the first expression simplifies to 9. Now, let me tackle the second expression: sqrt(6) + sqrt(32). Hmm, these aren't as straightforward. I know that sqrt(6) is an irrational number, approximately 2.449, but I don't remember the exact value. Similarly, sqrt(32) is also irrational, approximately 5.656, but I might have seen the exact value before.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify sqrt(32). Let me think. 32 is 16 times 2, right? So sqrt(32) is sqrt(16 * 2), which is sqrt(16) * sqrt(2), which is 4 * sqrt(2). That's helpful because sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so 4 times that is about 5.656. So sqrt(32) is 4*sqrt(2). \n\nSimilarly, sqrt(6) can be written as sqrt(6), which is approximately 2.449, but it doesn't simplify further. So, putting it all together, sqrt(6) + sqrt(32) is approximately 2.449 + 5.656, which adds up to about 8.105. \n\nWait a second, so sqrt(6) + sqrt(32) is approximately 8.105, and sqrt(4) + sqrt(49) is exactly 9. So 9 is larger than 8.105. Therefore, sqrt(4) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(32).\n\nBut hold on, maybe I should check my calculations without approximating. Let me try to see if I can find a way to compare these two expressions without converting them into decimals. Maybe by squaring both expressions? That could be a good idea because squaring might preserve the inequality.\n\nSo, let me denote A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(49) = 2 + 7 = 9, and B = sqrt(6) + sqrt(32). I need to compare A and B. If I square both sides, I can see which one is larger.\n\nLet's compute A squared: A^2 = (sqrt(4) + sqrt(49))^2. Expanding this, I get (sqrt(4))^2 + 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(49) + (sqrt(49))^2. Calculating each term, sqrt(4)^2 is 4, 2*sqrt(4)*sqrt(49) is 2*2*7=28, and sqrt(49)^2 is 49. So adding them up: 4 + 28 + 49 = 81.\n\nNow, compute B squared: B^2 = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(32))^2. Expanding this, (sqrt(6))^2 + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(32) + (sqrt(32))^2. Calculating each term: (sqrt(6))^2 is 6, 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(32) is 2*sqrt(192) because sqrt(6)*sqrt(32) is sqrt(6*32)=sqrt(192). And (sqrt(32))^2 is 32. So, B^2 = 6 + 2*sqrt(192) + 32.\n\nNow, let's compute 6 + 32, which is 38. So B^2 = 38 + 2*sqrt(192). Hmm, okay, now I need to compare A^2 and B^2, which are 81 and 38 + 2*sqrt(192), respectively.\n\nBut wait, 38 + 2*sqrt(192) is definitely less than 81 because 2*sqrt(192) is a positive number, so adding it to 38 would still be less than 81. Let me verify that. Let me compute sqrt(192). Since 192 is 64*3, sqrt(192) is sqrt(64*3) = 8*sqrt(3). And sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 8*1.732 is approximately 13.856. Therefore, 2*sqrt(192) is approximately 27.712. So, B^2 is approximately 38 + 27.712 = 65.712. \n\nComparing that to A^2 which is 81. So, 65.712 < 81, which means B^2 < A^2. Therefore, B < A. So, sqrt(6) + sqrt(32) is less than sqrt(4) + sqrt(49). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(4) + sqrt(49), which is 9.\n\nAlternatively, just to make sure, let me check my squaring method again because sometimes when you square, especially when dealing with sums, the cross terms can affect the outcome. But in this case, since both expressions are positive, squaring should preserve the inequality. So, as A^2 = 81 and B^2 = approximately 65.712, which are indeed less than 81, confirming that A is larger than B.\n\nTherefore, after this thorough checking, I can confidently say that sqrt(4) + sqrt(49) is larger than sqrt(6) + sqrt(32). So, the larger number is sqrt(4) + sqrt(49).\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the decimal approximations again. sqrt(4) is exactly 2, sqrt(49) is exactly 7, so adding them is 9, which is an integer, that's straightforward. sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, and sqrt(32) is approximately 5.656. Adding those together: 2.449 + 5.656 is approximately 8.105.\n\nSo, 9 is definitely larger than 8.105. So, the conclusion is that sqrt(4) + sqrt(49) is larger, which is 2 + 7, or 9.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe I can compare the two expressions without computing their exact values. Let me think about it. \n\nWe have sqrt(4) and sqrt(49). Since 4 is less than 6 and 49 is greater than 32, but wait, 6 is less than 32, so sqrt(6) is less than sqrt(32). But sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(49) is 7. So, 2 + something less than something else, but how does that help?\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the differences. Let me consider (sqrt(4) + sqrt(49)) - (sqrt(6) + sqrt(32)) = 9 - (sqrt(6) + sqrt(32)). If I can show that this difference is positive, then sqrt(4) + sqrt(49) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, compute (sqrt(4) + sqrt(49)) - (sqrt(6) + sqrt(32)) = 9 - sqrt(6) - sqrt(32). If this is positive, then it's larger.\n\nBut how can I evaluate this without a calculator? Maybe I can write 9 as sqrt(81), and then see if sqrt(81) is greater than sqrt(6) + sqrt(32). \n\nBut that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) can be compared to sqrt(c) + sqrt(d) by squaring both and seeing which is larger. Which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, in this case, I squared both, and found that A squared is 81, and B squared is approximately 65.712, which is less than 81, so A is greater than B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the expression (sqrt(4) + sqrt(49)) - (sqrt(6) + sqrt(32)) = 9 - sqrt(6) - sqrt(32). Let's compute sqrt(6) + sqrt(32). sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, sqrt(32) is approximately 5.656, so together they are approximately 8.105. 9 - 8.105 is approximately 0."

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(1) + sqrt(39) is larger than sqrt(21) + sqrt(32), or vice versa. Hmm, okay. Let me write down what I know.\n\nFirst, let me compute each of these square roots individually to see what they are approximately equal to. Maybe that will help me compare them more easily.\n\nStarting with sqrt(1), that's straightforward. The square root of 1 is just 1. So, sqrt(1) = 1.\n\nNext, sqrt(39). Hmm, 39 is a bit tricky. I know that 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(39) must be somewhere between 6 and 7. To get a better approximation, let's see: 6.2 squared is 38.44, which is very close to 39. So, sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245.\n\nMoving on to sqrt(21). Similarly, 16 is 4 squared, 25 is 5 squared, so sqrt(21) is between 4 and 5. Let's calculate it: 4.5 squared is 20.25, which is a bit less than 21. So, it's a little more than 4.5. Let me try 4.55 squared: 4.55 * 4.55 is 20.7025. Still a bit less. 4.6 squared is 21.16, which is just over 21. So, sqrt(21) is approximately 4.583.\n\nLastly, sqrt(32). Hmm, 5 squared is 25, 6 squared is 36, so sqrt(32) is between 5 and 6. Let's see: 5.6 squared is 31.36, and 5.7 squared is 32.49. So, sqrt(32) is approximately 5.656.\n\nOkay, so now I have approximate values:\n\n- sqrt(1) ≈ 1.0\n- sqrt(39) ≈ 6.245\n- sqrt(21) ≈ 4.583\n- sqrt(32) ≈ 5.656\n\nNow, let's compute the sums:\n\n1. sqrt(1) + sqrt(39) ≈ 1.0 + 6.245 ≈ 7.245\n2. sqrt(21) + sqrt(32) ≈ 4.583 + 5.656 ≈ 10.239\n\nWait a second, that can't be right. 7.245 is less than 10.239, so according to my approximate calculations, sqrt(21) + sqrt(32) is larger. But is that accurate?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 7.245 seems a bit low compared to 10.239.\n\nFirst, sqrt(39) is approximately 6.245. That seems right because 6.245 squared is 39. Let me confirm: 6.245 * 6.245. 6*6 is 36, 6*0.245 is 1.47, so 6*6.245 is 37.47. Then 0.245*6.245 is approximately 1.527, so total is 37.47 + 1.527 ≈ 39. Exactly. So sqrt(39) is correct.\n\nsqrt(21): I estimated around 4.583. Let me check that: 4.583 squared. 4 squared is 16, 0.583 squared is approximately 0.34, and the cross term is 2*4*0.583 = 4.664. So total is 16 + 4.664 + 0.34 ≈ 21.004. Close enough, so sqrt(21) is approximately 4.583.\n\nsqrt(32): I estimated around 5.656. Let's check: 5.656 squared. 5 squared is 25, 0.656 squared is about 0.430, and the cross term is 2*5*0.656 = 6.56. So total is 25 + 6.56 + 0.430 ≈ 32.000. So that's accurate.\n\nNow, sqrt(1) is 1, so 1 + 6.245 is 7.245. sqrt(21) + sqrt(32) is approximately 4.583 + 5.656 ≈ 10.239. So, indeed, 7.245 is less than 10.239. So according to this, sqrt(21) + sqrt(32) is larger.\n\nBut wait, another way to compare these sums is by squaring them. Because if a < b, then a^2 < b^2. But in this case, if sqrt(1) + sqrt(39) is less than sqrt(21) + sqrt(32), then (sqrt(1) + sqrt(39))^2 would be less than (sqrt(21) + sqrt(32))^2.\n\nLet me compute both squares:\n\n1. (sqrt(1) + sqrt(39))^2 = 1 + 2*sqrt(1*39) + 39 = 1 + 2*sqrt(39) + 39 = 40 + 2*sqrt(39)\n2. (sqrt(21) + sqrt(32))^2 = 21 + 2*sqrt(21*32) + 32 = 53 + 2*sqrt(672)\n\nSo, now I need to compare 40 + 2*sqrt(39) and 53 + 2*sqrt(672).\n\nWait, hold on. That seems a bit complicated. 40 vs 53 is already 40 < 53, but we have 2*sqrt(39) and 2*sqrt(672). Let's see if sqrt(672) is larger than sqrt(39). Since 672 is 64*10.5, so sqrt(672) is 8*sqrt(10.5). Whereas sqrt(39) is about 6.245. Let's compute sqrt(10.5): about 3.24, so 8*3.24 ≈ 25.92. So sqrt(672) ≈ 25.92, so 2*sqrt(672) ≈ 51.84.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(39) is about 6.245, so 2*sqrt(39) ≈ 12.49.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n1. 40 + 12.49 ≈ 52.49\n2. 53 + 51.84 ≈ 104.84\n\nSo, 52.49 < 104.84, which confirms that 40 + 2*sqrt(39) < 53 + 2*sqrt(672). Therefore, (sqrt(1) + sqrt(39))^2 < (sqrt(21) + sqrt(32))^2, so sqrt(1) + sqrt(39) < sqrt(21) + sqrt(32).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. This seems contradictory to my initial approximation, but when I squared, it's more precise. Maybe my initial estimation was just rough.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, 40 + 2*sqrt(39): 2*sqrt(39) is about 2*6.245 ≈ 12.49, so 40 + 12.49 ≈ 52.49.\n\n53 + 2*sqrt(672): 2*sqrt(672). Hmm, what is sqrt(672)? Let's compute 672.\n\nWait, 672 divided by 16 is 42, so sqrt(672) = sqrt(16*42) = 4*sqrt(42). What is sqrt(42)? Approximately 6.4807. So, 4*6.4807 ≈ 25.9228. So, 2*sqrt(672) ≈ 51.8456.\n\nTherefore, 53 + 51.8456 ≈ 104.8456.\n\nSo, indeed, 52"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(14) + sqrt(30) is larger than sqrt(21) + sqrt(22) or vice versa. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can compare the two sums by squaring them? That sounds like a common strategy when dealing with square roots. \n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(14) + sqrt(30) and B = sqrt(21) + sqrt(22). If I square both A and B, I can compare A² and B². If A² is larger, then A is larger; if B² is larger, then B is larger. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with A²:\nA² = (sqrt(14) + sqrt(30))²\nI know that (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², so applying that here:\nA² = (sqrt(14))² + 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(30) + (sqrt(30))²\nCalculating each term:\n- (sqrt(14))² = 14\n- (sqrt(30))² = 30\n- 2*sqrt(14)*sqrt(30) = 2*sqrt(14*30) = 2*sqrt(420)\n\nSo, A² = 14 + 30 + 2*sqrt(420) = 44 + 2*sqrt(420)\n\nNow, let's compute B²:\nB² = (sqrt(21) + sqrt(22))²\nAgain, using the expansion:\nB² = (sqrt(21))² + 2*sqrt(21)*sqrt(22) + (sqrt(22))²\nCalculating each term:\n- (sqrt(21))² = 21\n- (sqrt(22))² = 22\n- 2*sqrt(21)*sqrt(22) = 2*sqrt(21*22) = 2*sqrt(462)\n\nSo, B² = 21 + 22 + 2*sqrt(462) = 43 + 2*sqrt(462)\n\nNow, I need to compare A² and B²:\nA² = 44 + 2*sqrt(420)\nB² = 43 + 2*sqrt(462)\n\nTo determine which is larger, I can subtract the smaller sum from the larger sum. Let me compute A² - B²:\nA² - B² = (44 + 2*sqrt(420)) - (43 + 2*sqrt(462)) = 1 + 2*(sqrt(420) - sqrt(462))\n\nNow, the question is whether sqrt(420) - sqrt(462) is positive or negative. Since sqrt(420) is approximately sqrt(400 + 20) which is sqrt(400) + something, so around 20.5, and sqrt(462) is sqrt(441 + 21) which is sqrt(441) + something, so around 21.5. So, sqrt(420) is about 20.5 and sqrt(462) is about 21.5, so sqrt(420) - sqrt(462) is roughly -1. So, 2*(sqrt(420) - sqrt(462)) is approximately -2. Therefore, A² - B² is 1 - 2 = -1.\n\nSo, A² - B² is negative, which means A² < B². Therefore, A < B. So, sqrt(14) + sqrt(30) is less than sqrt(21) + sqrt(22). Therefore, sqrt(21) + sqrt(22) is larger.\n\nWait, let me verify my approximations because 420 is 20.5^2 and 462 is 21.5^2, but actually, 20.5^2 is 420.25 and 21.5^2 is 462.25. So, sqrt(420) is approximately 20.4939 and sqrt(462) is approximately 21.4914. So, sqrt(420) - sqrt(462) is approximately -1.0. So, 2*(sqrt(420) - sqrt(462)) is approximately -2. Therefore, A² - B² = 1 - 2 = -1. So, A² is less than B², so A is less than B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(21) + sqrt(22) is larger. Let me see if I can confirm this without approximations. Maybe by comparing sqrt(420) and sqrt(462). Since 420 is less than 462, sqrt(420) < sqrt(462), so sqrt(420) - sqrt(462) is negative. Therefore, 2*(sqrt(420) - sqrt(462)) is negative, so A² - B² is 1 + negative, which is less than 1. Since 1 is positive, it's still negative. So, A² < B², which means A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(21) + sqrt(22) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the difference between B² and A² and see whether it's positive or negative. Since A² = 44 + 2*sqrt(420) and B² = 43 + 2*sqrt(462). So, the difference is 1 + 2*(sqrt(420) - sqrt(462)). Let's denote D = sqrt(420) - sqrt(462). Since sqrt(462) > sqrt(420), D is negative. Let's compute D.\n\nWe can write sqrt(462) = sqrt(420 + 42) = sqrt(420 + 2*21) but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to rationalize D.\n\nWait, maybe I can write sqrt(462) = sqrt(420 + 42). Let me see if that can be expressed as sqrt(420) + something. Let me suppose sqrt(420 + x) = sqrt(420) + delta. Then, squaring both sides:\n\n420 + x = 420 + 2*sqrt(420)*delta + delta²\n\nSo, x = 2*sqrt(420)*delta + delta²\n\nBut we know that x = 42, so 42 = 2*sqrt(420)*delta + delta²\n\nAssuming delta is small, delta² is negligible, so approximately 42 ≈ 2*sqrt(420)*delta, so delta ≈ 42/(2*sqrt(420)) = 21/sqrt(420) = 21/(sqrt(420)). Let me compute sqrt(420) = sqrt(4*105) = 2*sqrt(105) ≈ 2*10.24695 ≈ 20.4939. Therefore, delta ≈ 21/20.4939 ≈ 1.023.\n\nBut since x = 42 and delta ≈ 1.023, then delta² ≈ (1.023)^2 ≈ 1.047\n\nTherefore, 42 ≈ 2*sqrt(420)*delta + delta² ≈ 2*20.4939*1.023 + 1.047 ≈ 42.0 + 1.047 ≈ 43.047\n\nBut we have x = 42, so 42 ≈ 43.047, which is not exact, but it shows that delta is a bit less than 1.023. So, sqrt(462) ≈ sqrt(420) + 1.023 - some small amount.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(420) - sqrt(462) ≈ -1.023 + some small amount, so approximately -1.023. Therefore, 2*(sqrt(420) - sqrt(462)) ≈ -2.046\n\nThus, A² - B² ≈ 1 - 2.046 ≈ -1.046, which is negative. Therefore, A² is less than B², meaning A is less than B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact value of sqrt(420) and sqrt(462) numerically to get a more accurate comparison.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(420):\n\nsqrt(420) = sqrt(4*105) = 2*sqrt(105)."

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out which is larger between sqrt(2) + sqrt(39) and sqrt(33) + sqrt(36). Hmm, okay. Let me write that down clearly:\n\nsqrt(2) + sqrt(39) vs. sqrt(33) + sqrt(36)\n\nFirst, maybe I can simplify sqrt(36) because that's a perfect square. Yeah, sqrt(36) is 6, right? So that part is easy. So then, the expression becomes:\n\nsqrt(2) + sqrt(39) vs. sqrt(33) + 6\n\nSo now, I have to compare sqrt(2) + sqrt(39) with sqrt(33) + 6. Hmm, maybe I can subtract 6 from both sides to make it easier? Let's try that.\n\nsqrt(2) + sqrt(39) - 6 vs. sqrt(33)\n\nSo now, I need to figure out whether sqrt(2) + sqrt(39) - 6 is greater than or less than sqrt(33). Hmm, okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions to eliminate the square roots. But I have to be careful because when I square sums, it doesn't distribute as simply as I might think. Let me recall the formula:\n\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\nSo, if I let A = sqrt(2) + sqrt(39) - 6 and B = sqrt(33), then I can compute A^2 and B^2 and compare them.\n\nLet me compute A^2:\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(39) - 6)^2\n\nExpanding that:\n\n= (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(39))^2 + (6)^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(39) - 2*sqrt(2)*6 - 2*sqrt(39)*6\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n= 2 + 39 + 36 + 2*sqrt(78) - 12*sqrt(2) - 12*sqrt(39)\n\nSo adding up the constants:\n\n2 + 39 = 41, 41 + 36 = 77\n\nSo, A^2 = 77 + 2*sqrt(78) - 12*sqrt(2) - 12*sqrt(39)\n\nAnd B^2 is just (sqrt(33))^2 = 33\n\nSo now, I have to compare 77 + 2*sqrt(78) - 12*sqrt(2) - 12*sqrt(39) vs. 33.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems a bit messy. Maybe instead of squaring both expressions, I should compare them in another way.\n\nAlternatively, since sqrt(2) + sqrt(39) is roughly something, and sqrt(33) is another number, maybe I can approximate their values numerically.\n\nAlright, let's try that. Let's compute each term's approximate value.\n\nsqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142\n\nsqrt(39) is approximately 6.2449\n\nsqrt(36) is 6, as we saw earlier.\n\nsqrt(33) is approximately 5.7446\n\nSo, let's compute the left-hand side: sqrt(2) + sqrt(39) ≈ 1.4142 + 6.2449 ≈ 7.6591\n\nAnd the right-hand side: sqrt(33) + sqrt(36) ≈ 5.7446 + 6 ≈ 11.7446\n\nWait, hold on, that's not right. Wait, no, the right-hand side is sqrt(33) + sqrt(36) which is ≈5.7446 +6≈11.7446, and the left-hand side is sqrt(2)+sqrt(39)≈7.6591. Wait, so according to this, sqrt(2)+sqrt(39) is approximately 7.6591, and sqrt(33)+sqrt(36) is approximately 11.7446. So clearly, sqrt(33) + sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive because sqrt(36) is a bigger number, but sqrt(2) is much smaller than sqrt(33). So maybe the sum is still larger.\n\nBut let me double-check the approximate values:\n\nsqrt(2) ≈1.4142\n\nsqrt(39) ≈6.2449\n\nSo sqrt(2)+sqrt(39)≈1.4142 +6.2449≈7.6591\n\nsqrt(33)≈5.7446\n\nsqrt(36)=6, so sqrt(33)+sqrt(36)=5.7446+6≈11.7446\n\nSo, yeah, 11.7446 is larger than 7.6591, so sqrt(33)+sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nWait, but let me think another way. Maybe I can consider the difference between the two sums.\n\nLet me define A = sqrt(2) + sqrt(39)\n\nAnd B = sqrt(33) + sqrt(36)\n\nI need to find whether A > B or A < B.\n\nSo, let's compute A - B: sqrt(2) + sqrt(39) - sqrt(33) - sqrt(36)\n\nSimplify sqrt(36) to 6: sqrt(2) + sqrt(39) - sqrt(33) - 6\n\nSo, A - B ≈1.4142 +6.2449 -5.7446 -6≈1.4142 +6.2449=7.6591; 5.7446 +6=11.7446; So 7.6591 -11.7446≈-4.0855\n\nSo, A - B≈-4.0855, which is negative. Therefore, A < B, so sqrt(33)+sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, I can square both A and B and compare. Let's try that.\n\nCompute A^2 = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(39))^2 = 2 + 39 + 2*sqrt(2*39) =41 + 2*sqrt(78)\n\nCompute B^2 = (sqrt(33) +6)^2 =33 +36 +2*sqrt(33*36)=69 +2*sqrt(1188)\n\nSo, A^2 =41 +2*sqrt(78)\n\nB^2=69 +2*sqrt(1188)\n\nCompute sqrt(78)≈8.8318\n\nsqrt(1188)=sqrt(4*297)=2*sqrt(297)=2*sqrt(9*33)=2*3*sqrt(33)=6*sqrt(33)≈6*5.7446≈34.4676\n\nSo, sqrt(1188)≈34.4676\n\nSo, B^2≈69 +2*34.4676≈69 +68.9352≈137.9352\n\nA^2≈41 +2*8.8318≈41 +17.6636≈58.6636\n\nSo, A^2≈58.6636 vs B^2≈137.9352\n\nSince A^2 < B^2, then A < B. Therefore, sqrt(33)+sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nBut wait, when I approximated the difference before, I got A - B≈-4.0855, which is negative, so A < B. So both methods confirm that sqrt(33)+sqrt(36) is larger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe another approach. Let me think about the function f(x) = sqrt(x) + sqrt(y -x). Maybe take derivative or something?\n\nWait, perhaps not necessary because I have two separate expressions. Alternatively, I can consider that sqrt(33) is about 5.7446, sqrt(39) is about 6.2449, sqrt(2) is 1.4142, sqrt(36)=6.\n\nSo, sqrt(33) + sqrt(36)=5.7446 +6≈11.7446\n\nsqrt(2) + sqrt(39)=1.4142 +6.2449≈7.6591\n\nSo, 11.7446 is clearly larger than 7.6591.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of the difference in a different way. For instance, is 11.7446 -11."

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(9) + sqrt(41) and sqrt(11) + sqrt(17). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(9) + sqrt(41) and sqrt(11) + sqrt(17). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(9) is just 3 because 3 squared is 9. That part is straightforward. So, sqrt(9) + sqrt(41) simplifies to 3 + sqrt(41). Now, sqrt(41) is a bit trickier, but I can calculate it approximately. Let me see, 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(41) is somewhere between 6 and 7. To get a better approximation, I can do a linear approximation or use a calculator method, but since I don't have one, I'll estimate it. Maybe 6.4 squared is 40.96, which is just about 41. So, sqrt(41) is approximately 6.4.\n\nSo, 3 + sqrt(41) is approximately 3 + 6.4 = 9.4. Okay, that's my first number. Now, I need to compare it with sqrt(11) + sqrt(17). Let me compute each of those.\n\nsqrt(11) is a number between 3 and 4 because 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16. Let me see, 3.3 squared is 10.89, which is just below 11. 3.3 squared is 10.89, so sqrt(11) is approximately 3.3166. Maybe I can remember that as about 3.317.\n\nsqrt(17) is a number between 4 and 5 because 4 squared is 16 and 5 squared is 25. 4.1 squared is 16.81, which is just above 17, so sqrt(17) is less than 4.1. Let me calculate 4.1 squared: 16.81. The difference is 17 - 16.81 = 0.19. So, maybe it's a little less than 4.1. Let's see, 4.1 squared is 16.81, 4.13 squared is 17.0569, which is a bit over. So, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123.\n\nSo, sqrt(11) is about 3.317 and sqrt(17) is about 4.123. Adding them together gives 3.317 + 4.123. Let's compute that. 3 + 4 is 7, 0.317 + 0.123 is 0.44, so total is 7.44. So, sqrt(11) + sqrt(17) is approximately 7.44.\n\nWait a second, that can't be right. Because sqrt(11) is roughly 3.3166 and sqrt(17) is roughly 4.1231. So, adding those together, 3.3166 + 4.1231. Let me compute that. 3 + 4 is 7, 0.3166 + 0.1231 is 0.4397, so total is approximately 7.4397, which is about 7.44. Okay, that checks out.\n\nSo, sqrt(9) + sqrt(41) is approximately 9.4, and sqrt(11) + sqrt(17) is approximately 7.44. So, clearly, sqrt(9) + sqrt(41) is larger. But wait, the problem says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, we need to confirm if 9.4 is indeed sqrt(9) + sqrt(41), which it is, and 7.44 is sqrt(11) + sqrt(17). So, 9.4 is bigger.\n\nBut, perhaps the problem expects an exact comparison rather than an approximate one. Hmm, maybe I should square both expressions to compare them exactly without approximating.\n\nThat might be a better approach because we can compare the squares directly, which avoids dealing with roots and decimals. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let me denote A = sqrt(9) + sqrt(41) and B = sqrt(11) + sqrt(17). I need to compare A and B.\n\nTo compare A and B, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and see which one is larger. Since both A and B are positive, squaring them preserves the inequality.\n\nCompute A^2: (sqrt(9) + sqrt(41))^2 = 9 + 2*sqrt(9*41) + 41 = (9 + 41) + 2*sqrt(369) = 50 + 2*sqrt(369).\n\nCompute B^2: (sqrt(11) + sqrt(17))^2 = 11 + 2*sqrt(11*17) + 17 = (11 + 17) + 2*sqrt(187) = 28 + 2*sqrt(187).\n\nSo, now we have A^2 = 50 + 2*sqrt(369) and B^2 = 28 + 2*sqrt(187). Now, we can subtract B^2 from A^2 to see which is larger.\n\nCompute A^2 - B^2: (50 - 28) + (2*sqrt(369) - 2*sqrt(187)) = 22 + 2*(sqrt(369) - sqrt(187)).\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 = 22 + 2*(sqrt(369) - sqrt(187)). Now, to determine if A^2 is greater than B^2, we need to see if sqrt(369) - sqrt(187) is positive.\n\nSince sqrt(369) is definitely bigger than sqrt(187) because 369 > 187. So, sqrt(369) - sqrt(187) is positive. Therefore, 22 + 2*(positive number) is positive, which means A^2 - B^2 is positive, so A^2 > B^2, which implies that A > B.\n\nSo, that means sqrt(9) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(11) + sqrt(17). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(9) + sqrt(41), which can be written as sqrt(9) + sqrt(41). But perhaps, they might want it in a different form? The problem says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, sqrt(9) + sqrt(41) is already in that form, so I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I can check my calculations because sometimes when comparing sqrt terms, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me verify my squaring steps again.\n\nA = sqrt(9) + sqrt(41) = 3 + sqrt(41). Squaring that: (3)^2 + 2*3*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))^2 = 9 + 6*sqrt(41) + 41 = 50 + 6*sqrt(41). Wait, wait a minute, earlier I thought A^2 was 50 + 2*sqrt(369). Hmm, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Let's recast that.\n\nWait, (sqrt(9) + sqrt(41))^2 is indeed 9 + 2*sqrt(9*41) + 41, which is 50 + 2*sqrt(369). But 9*41 is 369, right? 9*40 is 360, plus 9 is 369, yes. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, B = sqrt(11) + sqrt(17). Squaring that: 11 + 2*sqrt(11*17) + 17, which is 28 + 2*sqrt(187). So that part is also correct.\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 is 50 - 28 + 2*(sqrt(369) - sqrt(187)) = 22 + 2*(sqrt(369) - sqrt(187)). So, that is correct.\n\nNow, sqrt(369) is sqrt(9*41) = 3*sqrt(41). Similarly, sqrt(187) is sqrt(11*17). So, sqrt(369) = 3*sqrt(41) and sqrt(187) is as it is.\n\nWait, let"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(6) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(19) + sqrt(33). Hmm, okay. I guess I need to figure out which of these two sums is larger. I remember that sometimes you can compare square roots by looking at their approximate decimal values, but I'm not sure if that's the best way here. Maybe there's a more mathematical method to determine which sum is bigger without actually calculating the exact decimals.\n\nLet me write down the two expressions I need to compare:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(6) + sqrt(43)\n\nExpression B: sqrt(19) + sqrt(33)\n\nHmm, so both expressions have two square roots being added together. I wonder if there's a way to compare these without calculating the exact values. Maybe by squaring both expressions or something? Let me think.\n\nWhen you square a sum, you get (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So if I square both Expression A and Expression B, I can compare them. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's square Expression A:\n\n(A)^2 = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(43))^2 = (sqrt(6))^2 + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(43) + (sqrt(43))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(6))^2 = 6\n\n(sqrt(43))^2 = 43\n\nSo, adding those together: 6 + 43 = 49\n\nNow, the middle term is 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(43). Let's compute that:\n\n2*sqrt(6*43) = 2*sqrt(258)\n\nHmm, sqrt(258). I know that 16^2 is 256, so sqrt(256) is 16, and sqrt(257) is approximately 16.031, sqrt(258) is approximately 16.062. So, 2*sqrt(258) is roughly 2*16.062 = 32.124.\n\nSo, putting it all together, (A)^2 is approximately 49 + 32.124 = 81.124.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because 49 + 32.124 is actually 81.124, but 49 + 32.124 is 81.124, yes. But I think perhaps I should keep it symbolic for now.\n\nSo, (A)^2 = 49 + 2*sqrt(258)\n\nSimilarly, let's square Expression B:\n\n(B)^2 = (sqrt(19) + sqrt(33))^2 = (sqrt(19))^2 + 2*sqrt(19)*sqrt(33) + (sqrt(33))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(sqrt(19))^2 = 19\n\n(sqrt(33))^2 = 33\n\nAdding those together: 19 + 33 = 52\n\nMiddle term: 2*sqrt(19*33) = 2*sqrt(627)\n\nSo, (B)^2 = 52 + 2*sqrt(627)\n\nNow, we have (A)^2 = 49 + 2*sqrt(258) and (B)^2 = 52 + 2*sqrt(627). Hmm, so to compare (A)^2 and (B)^2, we can subtract 49 from both and 52 from both? Wait, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute both (A)^2 and (B)^2 and then compare them numerically.\n\nFirst, let's compute (A)^2:\n\nsqrt(258) is approximately 16.062, so 2*sqrt(258) ≈ 32.124\n\nThus, (A)^2 ≈ 49 + 32.124 = 81.124\n\nSimilarly, compute (B)^2:\n\nsqrt(627) is a bit trickier. Let's estimate sqrt(625) which is 25, and sqrt(627) is just a bit more. Let's say it's approximately 25.04. So, 2*sqrt(627) ≈ 2*25.04 = 50.08\n\nThus, (B)^2 ≈ 52 + 50.08 = 102.08\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So, (A)^2 is approximately 81.124 and (B)^2 is approximately 102.08. Therefore, since (A)^2 < (B)^2, that would imply that A < B.\n\nSo, sqrt(6) + sqrt(43) is less than sqrt(19) + sqrt(33). Therefore, sqrt(19) + sqrt(33) is larger. So, the answer is sqrt(19) + sqrt(33).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Let me check sqrt(258) again. 16^2 is 256, so sqrt(256) is 16, sqrt(257)≈16.031, sqrt(258)≈16.062, which is accurate. So 2*sqrt(258)=approx 32.124, so 49 + 32.124=81.124.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(627): 25^2=625, so sqrt(625)=25, sqrt(626)=25.02, sqrt(627)=25.04. So 2*sqrt(627)=approx 50.08. So 52 + 50.08=102.08. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(19) + sqrt(33) is larger.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to compare sqrt(6) + sqrt(43) and sqrt(19) + sqrt(33) without squaring.\n\nI remember that sometimes you can compare by seeing how close each pair is to a square. For instance, if you have x + y and a + b, you can try to see if (x - a) is similar to (b - y) or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the differences between the two sums.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(43) and sqrt(33) first.\n\nsqrt(33) is approximately 5.7446, because 5.7446^2=33.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(43)≈6.5574, because 6.5574^2=43.\n\nsqrt(19)≈4.3589, sqrt(6)≈2.4495.\n\nSo, Expression A: 2.4495 + 6.5574≈9.0069\n\nExpression B: 4.3589 + 5.7446≈10.1035\n\nWait, hold on, that seems different from my earlier squaring method.

Hmm, which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, wait, sorry, sqrt(6)≈2.4495, sqrt(43)≈6.5574, so Expression A is approximately 2.4495 + 6.5574≈9.0069.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(19)≈4.3589, sqrt(33)≈5.7446, so Expression B is approximately 4.3589 + 5.7446≈10.1035.\n\nSo, 9.0069 vs 10.1035, so Expression B is larger, which matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nBut wait, when I squared them, I got Expression A squared≈81.124 and Expression B squared≈102.08, so sqrt(81.124)=approx 9.0069, which is correct, and sqrt(102.08)=approx 10.1035, which is correct.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check my computations again because I thought that Expression A is sqrt(6) + sqrt(43)≈9.0069 and Expression B is sqrt(19)+sqrt(33)≈10.1035, so Expression B is bigger. Therefore, sqrt(19)+sqrt(33) is larger.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute Expression A and Expression B more accurately.\n\nCompute sqrt("

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(9) + sqrt(31) and sqrt(10) + sqrt(16). The task is to figure out which one is larger and then write the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(9) is a straightforward number because 9 is a perfect square. So sqrt(9) is 3. That makes the first expression 3 + sqrt(31). Now, sqrt(31) is a bit trickier because 31 isn't a perfect square, but I can approximate it if needed. Let me remember that sqrt(25) is 5 and sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(31) must be somewhere between 5 and 6. In fact, since 31 is closer to 36, it's probably around 5.5 or 5.6. Maybe I can calculate it more precisely later, but for now, I'll keep it as sqrt(31).\n\nMoving on to the second expression: sqrt(10) + sqrt(16). Again, sqrt(16) is a perfect square, so that’s 4. So the second expression simplifies to sqrt(10) + 4. Now, sqrt(10) is another number between 3 and 4 because 10 is between 9 and 16. Let me think, 3 squared is 9 and 4 squared is 16, so sqrt(10) must be approximately 3.16. I remember that sqrt(9.0) is 3 and sqrt(9.61) is 3.1, so sqrt(10) is a little over 3.1.\n\nSo, summarizing the two expressions:\n\nFirst expression: 3 + sqrt(31)\n\nSecond expression: 4 + sqrt(10)\n\nNow, to compare these two, I can see which one is bigger. Let's denote the first expression as A and the second as B.\n\nA = 3 + sqrt(31)\n\nB = 4 + sqrt(10)\n\nI can rewrite both expressions to make it easier to compare:\n\nA = 3 + sqrt(31) ≈ 3 + 5.567 ≈ 8.567\n\nB = 4 + sqrt(10) ≈ 4 + 3.162 ≈ 7.162\n\nWait, hold on, so if A is approximately 8.567 and B is approximately 7.162, then A is clearly larger. But let me verify this because approximating might not be precise enough. Maybe I should compare them algebraically without approximating.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the difference between A and B:\n\nA - B = (3 + sqrt(31)) - (4 + sqrt(10)) = (3 - 4) + (sqrt(31) - sqrt(10)) = -1 + (sqrt(31) - sqrt(10))\n\nSo, A - B = sqrt(31) - sqrt(10) - 1\n\nIf I can determine whether sqrt(31) - sqrt(10) is greater than 1, then A - B would be positive, meaning A is larger. Otherwise, B would be larger.\n\nLet me calculate sqrt(31) - sqrt(10):\n\nFirst, sqrt(31) is approximately 5.567 as I figured earlier, and sqrt(10) is approximately 3.162.\n\nSo, 5.567 - 3.162 ≈ 2.405\n\nThen, subtracting 1 gives 2.405 - 1 = 1.405\n\nWhich is positive. So, A - B ≈ 1.405, which is positive. Therefore, A is larger than B.\n\nBut wait, let me check these approximations again to be sure. Since sqrt(31) is actually approximately 5.567764363 and sqrt(10) is approximately 3.162277660. So:\n\nsqrt(31) ≈ 5.567764363\n\nsqrt(10) ≈ 3.162277660\n\nSo, sqrt(31) - sqrt(10) ≈ 5.567764363 - 3.162277660 ≈ 2.405486703\n\nThen, A - B = sqrt(31) - sqrt(10) - 1 ≈ 2.405486703 - 1 ≈ 1.405486703\n\nWhich is positive, so A - B is positive. So, A is larger than B.\n\nBut wait, let me think about another approach. Maybe squaring both expressions could help compare them without dealing with square roots directly.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(9) + sqrt(31) and B = sqrt(10) + sqrt(16). So, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and compare those.\n\nCompute A^2 = (sqrt(9) + sqrt(31))^2 = 9 + 2*sqrt(9*31) + 31 = 40 + 2*sqrt(279)\n\nCompute B^2 = (sqrt(10) + sqrt(16))^2 = 10 + 2*sqrt(10*16) + 16 = 26 + 2*sqrt(160)\n\nNow, we have A^2 = 40 + 2*sqrt(279) and B^2 = 26 + 2*sqrt(160). So, to compare A and B, we can compare A^2 and B^2.\n\nSo, let's compute A^2 - B^2 = (40 + 2*sqrt(279)) - (26 + 2*sqrt(160)) = 14 + 2*(sqrt(279) - sqrt(160))\n\nNow, compute sqrt(279) and sqrt(160):\n\nsqrt(279): Let's see, 17^2 is 289, so sqrt(279) is a bit less than 17. Let me compute 16^2 = 256 and 17^2 = 289, so sqrt(279) is between 16 and 17. To approximate, 279 is 256 + 23, so sqrt(279) ≈ 16 + 23/(2*16) = 16 + 23/32 ≈ 16 + 0.71875 ≈ 16.71875\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(160): 160 is between 144 (12^2) and 169 (13^2). Let me compute 12.6^2 = 158.76, which is close to 160. 12.6^2 = 158.76, so 12.6 + (160 - 158.76)/(2*12.6) ≈ 12.6 + 1.24/25.2 ≈ 12.6 + 0.049 ≈ 12.649\n\nSo, sqrt(160) ≈ 12.649\n\nThus, sqrt(279) - sqrt(160) ≈ 16.71875 - 12.649 ≈ 4.06975\n\nThen, 2*(sqrt(279) - sqrt(160)) ≈ 2*4.06975 ≈ 8.1395\n\nSo, A^2 - B^2 ≈ 14 + 8.1395 ≈ 22.1395\n\nWhich is positive. Therefore, A^2 > B^2, so A > B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(9) + sqrt(31) is larger than sqrt(10) + sqrt(16). So, the larger number is sqrt(9) + sqrt(31).\n\nBut the problem asks to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Well, in the first expression, it's already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), where a=9 and b=31. So, the larger number is sqrt(9) + sqrt(31).\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me verify this conclusion because sometimes when squaring, it's easy to make an error. Let me recompute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA = sqrt(9) + sqrt(31) = 3 + sqrt(31)\n\nA^2 = (3 + sqrt(31))^2 = 9 + 6*sqrt(31) + 31 = "

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compare two expressions: sqrt(11) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(28) + sqrt(29). I have to figure out which one is larger and then write down the larger one in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that sqrt(36) is 6 because 6 times 6 is 36. So, sqrt(11) + sqrt(36) simplifies to sqrt(11) + 6. That seems straightforward. Now, the other expression is sqrt(28) + sqrt(29). Hmm, these are both square roots of numbers that aren't perfect squares, so I can't simplify them as easily.\n\nI need to compare sqrt(11) + 6 and sqrt(28) + sqrt(29). Maybe I can approximate the values to see which one is larger. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with sqrt(11). I remember that sqrt(9) is 3 and sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(11) should be somewhere between 3 and 4. Let me calculate it more accurately. 3.3 squared is 10.89, which is close to 11. 3.3 squared is 10.89, so sqrt(11) is about 3.3166. Let me note that down: sqrt(11) ≈ 3.3166.\n\nAdding that to 6 gives me 3.3166 + 6 = 9.3166. So, the first expression is approximately 9.3166.\n\nNow, let's tackle the second expression: sqrt(28) + sqrt(29). I need to approximate both of these.\n\nStarting with sqrt(28). Since 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36, sqrt(28) is between 5 and 6. Let me calculate 5.2 squared: 5.2 * 5.2 is 27.04. That's pretty close to 28. So, sqrt(28) is a little more than 5.2. Let me try 5.29 squared: 5.29 * 5.29. Let me compute that.\n\n5.29 * 5 is 26.45, and 5.29 * 0.29 is approximately 1.5341. So total is about 26.45 + 1.5341 = 27.9841. Hmm, that's very close to 28. So, sqrt(28) is approximately 5.2915. Let me write that down: sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915.\n\nNext, sqrt(29). 5.3 squared is 28.09, so that's just a little less than 29. 5.3 squared is 28.09, so sqrt(29) is a little more than 5.3. Let me compute 5.39 squared: 5.39 * 5.39. Let me do 5 * 5 = 25, 5 * 0.39 = 1.95, 0.39 * 5 = 1.95, and 0.39 * 0.39 = 0.1521. Adding those together: 25 + 1.95 + 1.95 + 0.1521 = 25 + 3.9 + 0.1521 ≈ 29.0521. That's a bit more than 29, so sqrt(29) must be just a little less than 5.39. Let me try 5.38 squared: 5.38 * 5.38. Let's compute that.\n\n5 * 5 = 25,\n5 * 0.38 = 1.9,\n0.38 * 5 = 1.9,\n0.38 * 0.38 = 0.1444.\nAdding those together: 25 + 1.9 + 1.9 + 0.1444 = 25 + 3.8 + 0.1444 ≈ 28.9444. That's actually less than 29, so sqrt(29) is between 5.38 and 5.39.\n\nLet me try 5.385 squared: 5.385 * 5.385. Let me compute this:\n\nFirst, 5 * 5 = 25,\n5 * 0.385 = 1.925,\n0.385 * 5 = 1.925,\n0.385 * 0.385 ≈ 0.148225.\n\nAdding them together: 25 + 1.925 + 1.925 + 0.148225 ≈ 25 + 3.85 + 0.148225 ≈ 28.998225. That's pretty close to 29. So, sqrt(29) is approximately 5.385. Let me note that down: sqrt(29) ≈ 5.385.\n\nSo, putting it all together, sqrt(28) + sqrt(29) ≈ 5.2915 + 5.385 ≈ 10.6765.\n\nWait, hold on. That can't be right because 5.2915 + 5.385 is 10.6765? That seems too high because sqrt(28) is about 5.2915 and sqrt(29) is about 5.385, so their sum should be around 10.6765. But let me cross-verify.\n\nWait, 5.2915 + 5.385 is indeed 10.6765. Hmm, but the first expression was sqrt(11) + 6 ≈ 3.3166 + 6 = 9.3166, which is much less than 10.6765. So, that suggests that sqrt(28) + sqrt(29) is larger. But I have a feeling that might not be correct because sqrt(28) + sqrt(29) is about 10.6765, but sqrt(11) + 6 is 9.3166. Wait, but 10.6765 is definitely larger than 9.3166, so that would mean sqrt(28) + sqrt(29) is larger.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe my approximations are off. Maybe I should try a different approach instead of just approximating.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the difference between sqrt(28) + sqrt(29) and sqrt(11) + 6. If that difference is positive, then the second expression is larger; if negative, the first is larger.\n\nSo, compute sqrt(28) + sqrt(29) - sqrt(11) - 6.\n\nI can write this as (sqrt(28) - sqrt(11)) + (sqrt(29) - 6). Since sqrt(29) is approximately 5.385, which is greater than 6? Wait, no, 5.385 is less than 6. Wait, 5.385 is approximately 5.385, which is less than 6, so sqrt(29) - 6 is approximately -0.6145.\n\nMeanwhile, sqrt(28) is approximately 5.2915, so sqrt(28) - sqrt(11) is 5.2915 - 3.3166 ≈ 1.9749.\n\nSo, the total difference is approximately 1.9749 - 0.6145 ≈ 1.3604, which is positive. Therefore, sqrt(28) + sqrt(29) is actually larger than sqrt(11) + 6 by approximately 1.36.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with my initial calculation where I thought sqrt(28) + sqrt(29) was approximately 10.6765 and sqrt(11) + 6 was approximately 9.3166, so the difference is 10.6765 - 9.3166 ≈ 1.36, which is consistent.\n\nSo, that suggests that sqrt(28) + sqrt(29) is larger.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can square both expressions and compare them. Let me denote A = sqrt(11) + 6 and B = sqrt(28) + sqrt(29). Then, let's compute A² and B² and"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(26) + sqrt(44) is larger than sqrt(33) + sqrt(35) or vice versa. Hmm, I remember that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't play along with the same rules as addition. Maybe I should square both expressions to make them more manageable. \n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(26) + sqrt(44) and B = sqrt(33) + sqrt(35). So, if I can compare A² and B², that might tell me which one is larger. Let's calculate A² first.\n\nA² = (sqrt(26) + sqrt(44))². Using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b², I can expand this to 26 + 2*sqrt(26*44) + 44. Simplifying that, it's 26 + 44 + 2*sqrt(1144). Adding 26 and 44 gives me 70, so A² = 70 + 2*sqrt(1144). \n\nNow, let's compute B². B = sqrt(33) + sqrt(35), so B² = (sqrt(33) + sqrt(35))². Again, using the same formula, that becomes 33 + 2*sqrt(33*35) + 35. Adding 33 and 35 gives 68, so B² = 68 + 2*sqrt(1155).\n\nNow, comparing A² and B²: A² is 70 + 2*sqrt(1144) and B² is 68 + 2*sqrt(1155). Hmm, these are both in the form of constants plus twice a square root. It might help to isolate the square root terms and compare them.\n\nLet me subtract 68 from both sides to make it easier. So, A² - 68 = 2*sqrt(1144) and B² - 68 = 2*sqrt(1155). Now, subtract 2*sqrt(1144) from both sides in terms of B². So, B² - A² = (2*sqrt(1155) - 2*sqrt(1144)).\n\nHmm, that's a negative difference because sqrt(1155) is greater than sqrt(1144). So, B² - A² is negative, which means B² is less than A². Therefore, A is larger than B. So, sqrt(26) + sqrt(44) is larger than sqrt(33) + sqrt(35).\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check A² and B².\n\nFor A²: sqrt(26) is about 5.1, sqrt(44) is about 6.63, so adding them gives about 11.73. Squaring that, 11.73² is approximately 137.5. Let me compute 70 + 2*sqrt(1144). sqrt(1144) is approximately sqrt(1156) which is 34, so sqrt(1144) is about 33.8. So, 2*33.8 is about 67.6, so 70 + 67.6 is 137.6. That's pretty close to my manual calculation.\n\nFor B²: sqrt(33) is about 5.744, sqrt(35) is about 5.916, adding them gives about 11.66. Squaring that gives roughly 136. So, let me see B²: 68 + 2*sqrt(1155). sqrt(1155) is about 33.96, so 2*33.96 is about 67.92, so 68 + 67.92 is 135.92. That's close to my manual square as well.\n\nSo, A² is approximately 137.6 and B² is approximately 135.92, so indeed A² is larger. Therefore, A is larger than B. So, the answer is sqrt(26) + sqrt(44).\n\nWait, but hold on. Is there another way to compare without squaring? Maybe using the triangle inequality or something else? Hmm, I don't think triangle inequality applies here because we're dealing with sums of square roots, not sides of a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the difference between A and B and see if it's positive or negative. Let me try that.\n\nLet A = sqrt(26) + sqrt(44) and B = sqrt(33) + sqrt(35). Let me compute A - B.\n\nA - B = sqrt(26) + sqrt(44) - sqrt(33) - sqrt(35). Is this positive or negative?\n\nI can group terms: (sqrt(26) - sqrt(33)) + (sqrt(44) - sqrt(35)). Let me compute each difference.\n\nsqrt(26) is about 5.1, sqrt(33) is about 5.744, so sqrt(26) - sqrt(33) is approximately -0.644.\n\nsqrt(44) is about 6.633, sqrt(35) is about 5.916, so sqrt(44) - sqrt(35) is approximately 0.717.\n\nAdding those two differences: -0.644 + 0.717 = approximately 0.073. So, A - B is approximately 0.073, which is positive. Therefore, A is larger than B.\n\nSo, both methods, squaring and subtracting, show that A is larger. Therefore, sqrt(26) + sqrt(44) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: maybe compare each pair individually. Let's see, can I say sqrt(26) + sqrt(44) is greater than sqrt(33) + sqrt(35)?\n\nWell, sqrt(26) is less than sqrt(33), but sqrt(44) is greater than sqrt(35). So, it's not immediately clear which effect is stronger. But in the previous calculations, A > B, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe write all terms in terms of sqrt(26), sqrt(33), sqrt(35), sqrt(44). Maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, think about the function f(x, y) = sqrt(x) + sqrt(y). Is this function concave or convex? Since both sqrt(x) and sqrt(y) are concave functions, their sum is also concave.\n\nBy Jensen's inequality, for concave functions, the function evaluated at the average is greater than or equal to the average of the function. But I don't know if that directly helps here.\n\nAlternatively, use the concept that for positive numbers a, b, if a > c and b < d, then a + b may not necessarily be greater than c + d, but in this case, both a and b are larger than their counterparts.\n\nWait, but in this case, sqrt(26) is less than sqrt(33), but sqrt(44) is greater than sqrt(35). So, it's a balance. Maybe the net effect is that A is larger. As in, the gain from sqrt(44) outweighs the loss from sqrt(26).\n\nAlternatively, think about the difference:\n\nA - B = sqrt(26) + sqrt(44) - sqrt(33) - sqrt(35) > 0?\n\nWhich I computed as approximately 0.073. So, that's positive. Therefore, A is greater.\n\nAlternatively, maybe approximate the square roots more precisely.\n\nCompute sqrt(26): 5.1 + (0.1)/(2*5.1) = 5.1 + 0.0098 ≈ 5.1098.\n\nsqrt(33): 5.7446 (since 5.7446² ≈ 33).\n\nsqrt(35): 5.9161 (since 5.9161² ≈ 35).\n\nsqrt(44): 6.6332 (since 6.6332² ≈ 44).\n\nSo, A = 5.1098 + 6.6332 ≈ 11.743.\n\nB = 5.7446 + 5.9161 ≈ 11.6607.\n\nSo, A ≈ 11.743, B ≈ 11.6607. Therefore, A is larger.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(26) + sqrt(44) is larger.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe square both sides but more accurately.\n\nCompute A² = (sqrt(26) + sqrt(44))² = 26 + 44 + 2*sqrt(26*4"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to compare sqrt(13) + sqrt(30) and sqrt(20) + sqrt(23) and figure out which one is larger. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes when you have two square roots added together, you can compare them by squaring both expressions. That might make it easier to see which one is larger without having to compute the exact decimal values. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet’s denote A = sqrt(13) + sqrt(30) and B = sqrt(20) + sqrt(23). I need to find out whether A is greater than B or vice versa.\n\nTo compare A and B, let's square both to see which is larger. So, A² = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(30))² and B² = (sqrt(20) + sqrt(23))².\n\nCalculating A²: (sqrt(13))² + 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(30) + (sqrt(30))² = 13 + 2*sqrt(420) + 30. Simplifying that, 13 + 30 is 43, so A² = 43 + 2*sqrt(420).\n\nSimilarly, calculating B²: (sqrt(20))² + 2*sqrt(20)*sqrt(23) + (sqrt(23))² = 20 + 2*sqrt(460) + 23. Adding 20 and 23 gives 43, so B² = 43 + 2*sqrt(460).\n\nNow, to compare A² and B², we can subtract 43 from both, so we just need to compare 2*sqrt(420) and 2*sqrt(460). Since 2 is a common factor, we can divide both sides by 2, so we just need to compare sqrt(420) and sqrt(460).\n\nI know that sqrt(420) is less than sqrt(460) because 420 is less than 460, and the square root function is increasing. Therefore, sqrt(420) < sqrt(460), which implies that 2*sqrt(420) < 2*sqrt(460). Thus, A² < B².\n\nSince A² is less than B², that means A is less than B. So, sqrt(13) + sqrt(30) is smaller than sqrt(20) + sqrt(23).\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. It's easy to mix up which number is larger when squaring, but let's verify.\n\nA² = 43 + 2*sqrt(420)\nB² = 43 + 2*sqrt(460)\n\nYes, 420 is definitely less than 460, so sqrt(420) is less than sqrt(460), which makes A² less than B², so A is less than B.\n\nAlternatively, I could have compared sqrt(13) + sqrt(30) and sqrt(20) + sqrt(23) directly by estimating their approximate decimal values.\n\nLet me try that as a cross-check.\n\nCalculating sqrt(13): sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(13) is approximately 3.6055.\n\nCalculating sqrt(30): sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6, so sqrt(30) is approximately 5.4772.\n\nAdding them together: 3.6055 + 5.4772 ≈ 9.0827.\n\nNow, calculating sqrt(20): sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(20) is approximately 4.4721.\n\nCalculating sqrt(23): sqrt(16) is 4, sqrt(25) is 5, so sqrt(23) is approximately 4.7958.\n\nAdding them together: 4.4721 + 4.7958 ≈ 9.2679.\n\nComparing the two results: 9.0827 vs. 9.2679. So, 9.2679 is larger than 9.0827. Therefore, sqrt(20) + sqrt(23) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(30). That matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nJust to make sure, let's approximate the square roots more accurately.\n\nFor sqrt(13):\n3.605551275 is a known approximation.\n\nFor sqrt(30):\n5.477225575 is another known approximation.\n\nAdding them: 3.605551275 + 5.477225575 ≈ 9.08277685.\n\nFor sqrt(20):\n4.472135955 is an accurate approximation.\n\nFor sqrt(23):\n4.795831523 is another accurate approximation.\n\nAdding them: 4.472135955 + 4.795831523 ≈ 9.267967478.\n\nSo, again, 9.267967478 is greater than 9.08277685, so sqrt(20) + sqrt(23) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, I could also square the differences to see how much each term contributes to the total.\n\nBut I think we've confirmed it enough ways: squaring both expressions and also by estimating the square roots and their sums. Both approaches lead us to the conclusion that sqrt(20) + sqrt(23) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(30).\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(20) + sqrt(23), which can be written as \\boxed{\\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{23}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{23}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{13} + \\sqrt{30}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{23}\\), we can square both expressions to make it easier to determine which is larger.\n\nLet \\(A = \\sqrt{13} + \\sqrt{30}\\) and \\(B = \\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{23}\\).\n\nFirst, we square \\(A\\):\n\\[\nA^2 = (\\sqrt{13} + \\sqrt{30})^2 = 13 + 2\\sqrt{420} + 30 = 43 + 2\\sqrt{420}\n\\]\n\nNext, we square \\(B\\):\n\\[\nB^2 = (\\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{23})^2 = 20 + 2\\sqrt{460} + 23 = 43 + 2\\sqrt{460}\n\\]\n\nWe need to compare \\(43 + 2\\sqrt{420}\\) and \\(43 + 2\\sqrt{460}\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{420} < \\sqrt{460}\\), it follows that \\(2\\sqrt{420} < 2\\sqrt{460}\\). Therefore, \\(A^2 < B^2\\), which implies \\(A < B\\).\n\nTo further verify, we approximate the values:\n- \\(\\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.6055\\), \\(\\sqrt{30} \\approx 5.4772\\)\n- \\(3.6055 + 5.4772 \\approx 9.0827\\)\n\n- \\(\\sqrt{20} \\approx 4.4721\\), \\(\\sqrt{23} \\approx 4.7958\\)\n- \\(4.4721 + 4.7958 \\approx 9.2679\\)\n\nSince \\(9.2679\\) is greater than \\(9.0827\\), \\(\\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{23}\\) is larger.\n\nThus, the larger number is \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{23}}\\)."

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have to compare sqrt(20) + sqrt(46) and sqrt(29) + sqrt(35). Hmm, I wonder how I can figure out which one is larger without calculating the exact decimal values. Maybe I can find some way to compare these sums using properties of square roots or maybe even some algebraic manipulation.\n\nLet me write down both expressions for clarity:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(20) + sqrt(46)\nExpression B: sqrt(29) + sqrt(35)\n\nI need to determine whether A is greater than B or vice versa. Maybe I can square both expressions to eliminate the square roots and make it easier to compare. But wait, I remember that squaring can sometimes introduce extra solutions or make things more complicated, so I have to be careful.\n\nLet me denote Expression A as S and Expression B as T for simplicity.\n\nSo, S = sqrt(20) + sqrt(46)\nT = sqrt(29) + sqrt(35)\n\nI want to compare S and T.

Hmm, okay, so let's see which one is larger.\n\nFirst, I can subtract 64 from both to make it simpler:\n\nS² - 64 = 2*sqrt(920)\nT² - 64 = 2*sqrt(1015)\n\nWait, actually, that doesn't help much. Maybe I can compare 66 + 2*sqrt(920) and 64 + 2*sqrt(1015). Let's subtract the smaller number from the larger one to see the difference.\n\nSo, let's compute S² - T²:\n\nS² - T² = (66 + 2*sqrt(920)) - (64 + 2*sqrt(1015))\n= 2 + 2*(sqrt(920) - sqrt(1015))\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, S² - T² = 2 + 2*(sqrt(920) - sqrt(1015)). Now, I need to figure out whether this is positive or negative.\n\nIf sqrt(920) - sqrt(1015) is positive, then the entire expression will be positive, so S² > T², meaning S > T.\n\nIf it's negative, then S² < T², meaning S < T.\n\nSo, let's compute sqrt(920) and sqrt(1015) to see which is larger.\n\nI know that 30² = 900, 31² = 961, 32²=1024, 33²=1089.\n\nWait, 920 is between 30²=900 and 31²=961, so sqrt(920) is between 30 and 31.\n\nSimilarly, 1015 is between 31²=961 and 32²=1024, so sqrt(1015) is between 31 and 32. Let's get more precise.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(920):\n\n30² = 900\n30.5² = (30 + 0.5)² = 30² + 2*30*0.5 + 0.5² = 900 + 30 + 0.25 = 930.25\n30.5² = 930.25, which is more than 920. So, sqrt(920) is less than 30.5.\n\n30.3² = (30 + 0.3)² = 30² + 2*30*0.3 + 0.3² = 900 + 18 + 0.09 = 918.09\n30.4² = (30 + 0.4)² = 900 + 24 + 0.16 = 924.16\n\nSo, 30.3² = 918.09 and 30.4² = 924.16. Therefore, sqrt(920) is between 30.3 and 30.4.\n\nLet me approximate it.\n\nLet's compute 30.3 + (920 - 918.09)/(924.16 - 918.09) * 0.1\n\nSo, 920 - 918.09 = 1.91\n\n924.16 - 918.09 = 6.07\n\nSo, 1.91 / 6.07 ≈ 0.314\n\nSo, sqrt(920) ≈ 30.3 + 0.314*0.1 ≈ 30.3 + 0.0314 ≈ 30.3314\n\nLet me check 30.33²:\n\n30.33² = (30 + 0.33)² = 30² + 2*30*0.33 + 0.33² = 900 + 19.8 + 0.1089 ≈ 919.9089\n\nWhich is very close to 920. So, sqrt(920) ≈ 30.33.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1015):\n\n31² = 961, 32²=1024, so sqrt(1015) is between 31 and 32.\n\nCompute 31.5² = (31 + 0.5)² = 31² + 2*31*0.5 + 0.5² = 961 + 31 + 0.25 = 992.25\n\n31.7² = (31 + 0.7)² = 31² + 2*31*0.7 + 0.7² = 961 + 43.4 + 0.49 = 1004.89\n\nWait, 31.7² is 1004.89, which is more than 1015? No, 1004.89 is less than 1015.\n\nWait, 31.7² = 1004.89, 31.8² = (31 + 0.8)² = 31² + 2*31*0.8 + 0.8² = 961 + 49.6 + 0.64 = 1011.24\n\n31.9² = (31 + 0.9)² = 31² + 2*31*0.9 + 0.9² = 961 + 55.8 + 0.81 = 1017.61\n\nSo, sqrt(1015) is between 31.8 and 31.9.\n\nCompute 31.8² = 1011.24\n\nDifference between 1015 and 1011.24 is 3.76\n\nAnd 31.9² - 31.8² = 1017.61 - 1011.24 = 6.37\n\nSo, to approximate sqrt(1015):\n\nWe have 31.8² = 1011.24\n\n31.8 + x squared is 1015.\n\nSo, (31.8 + x)² = 31.8² + 2*31.8*x + x² = 1011.24 + 63"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which is larger: sqrt(29) + sqrt(48) or sqrt(36) + sqrt(46). Hmm, let's see. I remember that squaring can help compare sums of square roots, but I'm not entirely sure how to do that. Maybe I can calculate each side numerically and compare the results?\n\nAlright, let me get a calculator ready. First, sqrt(29). I know that 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36, so sqrt(29) should be a bit more than 5. Let me compute it: 5.3851... So, sqrt(29) ≈ 5.3851.\n\nNext, sqrt(48). Hmm, 6 squared is 36, and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(48) is a bit less than 7. Calculating that: 6.9282... So, sqrt(48) ≈ 6.9282.\n\nNow, adding them together: 5.3851 + 6.9282. Let me add those: 5 + 6 is 11, 0.3851 + 0.9282 is about 1.3133. So total is approximately 12.3133.\n\nOkay, moving on to the other side: sqrt(36) + sqrt(46). Well, sqrt(36) is 6, that's straightforward. Now, sqrt(46). 6 squared is 36, 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(46) is between 6 and 7. Let me compute it: 6.7823... So, sqrt(46) ≈ 6.7823.\n\nAdding them together: 6 + 6.7823 is 12.7823.\n\nComparing both results: 12.3133 vs. 12.7823. Clearly, 12.7823 is larger. So, sqrt(36) + sqrt(46) is larger than sqrt(29) + sqrt(48). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(36) + sqrt(46).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes approximations can be misleading. For sqrt(29):\n\n5.3851 squared is (5.3851)^2. Let me compute that:\n\n5^2 = 25\n\n2*5*0.3851 = 19.255\n\n(0.3851)^2 ≈ 0.1483\n\nSo total: 25 + 19.255 + 0.1483 ≈ 44.4033. Hmm, but 5.3851 squared is more than 25, but 25 is 5 squared. Wait, maybe I should have used a better approximation method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. Let me take a = 5, b = 0.3851.\n\nSo, (5 + 0.3851)^2 = 25 + 2*5*0.3851 + (0.3851)^2\n\n= 25 + 3.851 + 0.1483\n\n= 25 + 3.851 = 28.851 + 0.1483 ≈ 28.9993, which is approximately 29. So, that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(48):\n\n6.9282 squared. Let's check: 7^2 is 49, so 6.9282 is 0.0718 less than 7.\n\nUsing the formula (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2, where a = 7, b = 0.0718.\n\nSo, 49 - 2*7*0.0718 + (0.0718)^2 ≈ 49 - 0.9992 + 0.00515 ≈ 49 - 0.9992 is 48.0008 + 0.00515 ≈ 48.00595. Hmm, which is close to 48, so that also checks out.\n\nOkay, so the approximations are pretty accurate.\n\nSimilarly, let's check sqrt(46):\n\n6.7823 squared. Let's use the same method. 6.7823 is 0.2177 less than 7.\n\nSo, (7 - 0.2177)^2 = 49 - 2*7*0.2177 + (0.2177)^2 ≈ 49 - 3.0478 + 0.0474 ≈ 49 - 3.0478 is 45.9522 + 0.0474 ≈ 46. So, that also checks out.\n\nAlright, so the decimal approximations for each square root are pretty accurate, so their sums should be too.\n\nSo, sqrt(29) ≈ 5.3851, sqrt(48) ≈ 6.9282, adding up to approximately 12.3133.\n\nsqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(46) ≈ 6.7823, adding up to approximately 12.7823.\n\nSo, 12.7823 is larger than 12.3133, so sqrt(36) + sqrt(46) is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way without approximating. Maybe compare the two sums squared?\n\nWait, let me think: If I square both sums, I can compare them.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(29) + sqrt(48)\n\nand B = sqrt(36) + sqrt(46)\n\nCompute A^2 and B^2 and see which is larger.\n\nCompute A^2 = (sqrt(29) + sqrt(48))^2 = 29 + 48 + 2*sqrt(29*48) = 77 + 2*sqrt(1392)\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(36) + sqrt(46))^2 = 36 + 46 + 2*sqrt(36*46) = 82 + 2*sqrt(1656)\n\nSo, A^2 = 77 + 2*sqrt(1392)\n\nB^2 = 82 + 2*sqrt(1656)\n\nSo now, let's compute sqrt(1392) and sqrt(1656)\n\nCompute sqrt(1392):\n\nWell, 37^2 is 1369, 38^2 is 1444. So sqrt(1392) is between 37 and 38.\n\nCompute 37.3^2: 37^2 + 2*37*0.3 + 0.3^2 = 1369 + 22.2 + 0.09 = 1391.29. Hmm, that's very close to 1392.\n\nSo, 37.3^2 = 1391.29, so sqrt(1392) ≈ 37.3 + (1392 - 1391.29)/(2*37.3) ≈ 37.3 + 0.71/74.6 ≈ 37.3 + 0.0095 ≈ 37.3095.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1656):\n\nWell, 40^2 is 1600, 41^2 is 1681, so sqrt(1656) is between 40 and 41.\n\nCompute 40.7^2: 40^2 + 2*40*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 1600 + 56 + 0.49 = 1656.49. Hmm, that's very close to 1656.\n\nSo, 40.7^2 = 1656.49, so sqrt(1656) ≈ 40.7 - (1656.49 - 1656)/(2*40.7) ≈ 40.7 - 0.49/81.4 ≈ 40.7 - 0.006 is approximately 40.694.\n\nSo, sqrt(1392) ≈ 37.3095\n\nsqrt(1656) ≈ "

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to compare sqrt(1) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(8) + sqrt(28). Then, I have to figure out which one is larger and write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute each of these square roots individually because that might make it easier to compare them. So, starting with sqrt(1). I know that 1 squared is 1, so sqrt(1) must be 1. That part was straightforward.\n\nNext, sqrt(36). Hmm, 6 squared is 36, right? So, sqrt(36) is 6. Okay, so far so good. So, if I add sqrt(1) and sqrt(36), it's 1 + 6, which equals 7. Got that down. So, the first expression simplifies to 7.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(8) + sqrt(28). These aren't as straightforward as the first two. I need to figure out what sqrt(8) and sqrt(28) are. Let me see.\n\nStarting with sqrt(8). I know that 8 can be broken down into 4 and 2, since 4 times 2 is 8. And sqrt(4) is 2, so sqrt(8) is sqrt(4*2), which is sqrt(4)*sqrt(2). That would be 2*sqrt(2). Hmm, okay, so sqrt(8) is 2 times sqrt(2). I think that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(28). Let's break 28 down. 28 is 4 times 7, right? So, sqrt(28) is sqrt(4*7), which is sqrt(4)*sqrt(7). That simplifies to 2*sqrt(7). Got it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, sqrt(8) + sqrt(28) is 2*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(7). I can factor out the 2, so that becomes 2*(sqrt(2) + sqrt(7)). Hmm, that might be helpful for comparison.\n\nNow, let's compare the two results. The first expression was 7, and the second expression is 2*(sqrt(2) + sqrt(7)). So, I need to figure out which is larger: 7 or 2*(sqrt(2) + sqrt(7)).\n\nTo make this comparison easier, maybe I can compute the numerical values of each side. That way, I can see which one is bigger visually.\n\nStarting with the first expression, 7 is obviously straightforward. It's just 7. The second expression, though, is a bit more complicated because of the square roots. Let me compute sqrt(2) and sqrt(7) first.\n\nI know that sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, right? And sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458. So, adding those together: 1.4142 + 2.6458 equals about 4.0600. Okay, so sqrt(2) + sqrt(7) is roughly 4.0600.\n\nThen, multiplying that by 2, as in 2*(sqrt(2) + sqrt(7)), we get 2*4.0600, which is approximately 8.1200. So, the second expression is approximately 8.12, which is larger than 7.\n\nWait a second, hold on. So, sqrt(8) + sqrt(28) is approximately 8.12, whereas sqrt(1) + sqrt(36) is 7. So, 8.12 is definitely larger. So, that would mean that sqrt(8) + sqrt(28) is larger than sqrt(1) + sqrt(36).\n\nBut, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me double-check.\n\nFirst, sqrt(1) is 1, correct. sqrt(36) is 6, correct. So, 1 + 6 is 7, that's solid.\n\nNow, sqrt(8). As I said, 8 is 4*2, so sqrt(8) is 2*sqrt(2). Let me confirm: sqrt(4) is 2, 2*sqrt(2) is about 2.8284, correct. So, sqrt(8) is approximately 2.8284.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(28). 28 is 4*7, so sqrt(28) is 2*sqrt(7). Let me confirm that: sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458, so 2*2.6458 is approximately 5.2916.\n\nNow, adding sqrt(8) and sqrt(28): 2.8284 + 5.2916. Let's add those together. 2.8284 + 5.2916 equals 8.1200. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, sqrt(8) + sqrt(28) is approximately 8.12, which is bigger than 7.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(8) + sqrt(28). So, in the form they asked for, which is sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), we just need to write it as sqrt(8) + sqrt(28). So, I think that's it.\n\nBut, just to make sure I didn't miss anything, maybe I can think if there's another way to compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(28) and sqrt(1) + sqrt(36) without computing the numerical values.\n\nLet me consider that sqrt(8) is equal to 2*sqrt(2), and sqrt(28) is equal to 2*sqrt(7). So, adding them gives 2*(sqrt(2) + sqrt(7)), as I did earlier.\n\nSo, comparing 7 and 2*(sqrt(2) + sqrt(7)), which I have already established 2*(sqrt(2) + sqrt(7)) is approximately 8.12, so it's larger than 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both sides to avoid dealing with decimals. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(1) + sqrt(36) = 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nDenote B = sqrt(8) + sqrt(28).\n\nI need to compare A and B.\n\nSo, if I square both A and B, I can compare A^2 and B^2.\n\nCompute A^2: (1 + 6)^2 = 7^2 = 49.\n\nCompute B^2: (sqrt(8) + sqrt(28))^2. Let's expand that.\n\nUsing the formula (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2.\n\nSo, (sqrt(8))^2 + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(28) + (sqrt(28))^2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(sqrt(8))^2 = 8.\n\n(sqrt(28))^2 = 28.\n\nMiddle term: 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(28) = 2*sqrt(8*28).\n\nSimplify inside the square root: 8*28 is 224.\n\nSo, sqrt(224). Hmm, 224 is 16*14, so sqrt(224) is sqrt(16*14) = 4*sqrt(14).\n\nTherefore, the middle term is 2*(4*sqrt(14)) = 8*sqrt(14).\n\nSo, putting it all together, B^2 = 8 + 8*sqrt(14) + 28.\n\nSimplify that: 8 + 28 is 36, so B^2 = 36 + 8*sqrt(14).\n\nNow, A^2 is 49, and B^2 is 36 + 8*sqrt(14). So, to compare A^2 and B^2, I can subtract B^2 from A^2 to see if it's positive or negative.\n\nCompute A^2 - B^2 = 49 - (36 + 8*sqrt(14)) = 13 - 8*sqrt(14).\n\nSo, is 13 - 8*sqrt(14) positive or negative?\n\nCompute 8*sqrt(14). Since sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417, 8*3.7417 is approximately 29.9336.\n\nSo, 13 - 29.9336 is approximately -16.9336, which is negative.\n\nSince A^2 - B^2 is negative, that means A^2 < B^2, so A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1) + sqrt(36) is less than sqrt(8) + sqrt(28).\n\nSo, that confirms it again. So, the larger number is sqrt(8) + sqrt(28).\n\nTherefore, the answer is sqrt(8) + sqrt(28), which is in the required form.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute sqrt"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(28) and sqrt(19) + sqrt(22). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(8) + sqrt(28) and sqrt(19) + sqrt(22). And then, whichever one is larger, I need to write it in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, comparing two sums of square roots can sometimes be tricky because square roots don't distribute over addition. That is, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) isn't the same as sqrt(a + b). So, I can't just add 8 and 28 or 19 and 22 and compare those sums directly. I need a different approach.\n\nMaybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare. When I square a sum, it becomes the sum of squares plus twice the product. So, if I let A = sqrt(8) + sqrt(28) and B = sqrt(19) + sqrt(22), then:\n\nA² = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(28))² = 8 + 28 + 2*sqrt(8*28) = 36 + 2*sqrt(224)\nB² = (sqrt(19) + sqrt(22))² = 19 + 22 + 2*sqrt(19*22) = 41 + 2*sqrt(418)\n\nSo now, I have A² = 36 + 2*sqrt(224) and B² = 41 + 2*sqrt(418). To compare A² and B², I need to see which is larger. Let me compute both 2*sqrt(224) and 2*sqrt(418).\n\nFirst, sqrt(224). Hmm, 224 is 16*14, so sqrt(224) = sqrt(16*14) = 4*sqrt(14). Similarly, sqrt(418): 418 is 2*11*19, which doesn't simplify nicely, so I'll just leave it as sqrt(418).\n\nSo, A² = 36 + 2*(4*sqrt(14)) = 36 + 8*sqrt(14)\nB² = 41 + 2*sqrt(418)\n\nNow, let's compute the numerical values to see which is larger.\n\nFirst, sqrt(14). I remember that sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(14) is somewhere between 3.5 and 3.61. Let me calculate it more precisely.\n\n3.5 squared is 12.25, 3.6 squared is 12.96, so 14 is 1.75 above 12.25. So, sqrt(14) is approximately 3.7417 (I remember that sqrt(14) is roughly 3.7417). So, 8*sqrt(14) is approximately 8*3.7417 = 29.9336.\n\nThus, A² ≈ 36 + 29.9336 = 65.9336.\n\nNow, for B², sqrt(418). Hmm, 418 is between 400 and 441, so sqrt(400) is 20, sqrt(441) is 21. Let's see how close 418 is to 441. 441 - 418 = 23. So, sqrt(418) is 21 minus a little. Let's approximate it.\n\nI know that (21 - x)^2 = 418. Let's expand that: 441 - 42x + x² = 418. So, 441 - 418 = 23 = 42x - x². Since x is small, x² is negligible, so 42x ≈23, so x≈23/42≈0.5476. So, sqrt(418)≈21 - 0.5476≈20.4524.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(418)≈2*20.4524≈40.9048.\n\nThus, B²≈41 + 40.9048≈81.9048.\n\nSo, comparing A²≈65.9336 and B²≈81.9048. So, clearly, B² is larger. So, B is larger than A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(19) + sqrt(22) is larger than sqrt(8) + sqrt(28). So, I need to write it in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). Looking back, a=19 and b=22. So, the answer is sqrt(19) + sqrt(22).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with square roots.\n\nFirst, A² = 36 + 2*sqrt(224). sqrt(224)=sqrt(16*14)=4*sqrt(14)=approx 4*3.7417≈14.9668. So, 2*sqrt(224)≈29.9336. So, 36 + 29.9336≈65.9336, that's correct.\n\nNow, B² = 41 + 2*sqrt(418). sqrt(418)=sqrt(400 + 18)=sqrt(400 + 18). Let me see, 20^2=400, so 20 + x, where x is small. So, (20 + x)^2=400 + 40x + x²=418. So, 40x +x²=18. So, x≈18/40=0.45. So, sqrt(418)≈20.45. Thus, 2*sqrt(418)=40.9, so B²≈41 +40.9=81.9. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, yes, B² is bigger, so sqrt(19)+sqrt(22) is larger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, is there another way to compare sqrt(8)+sqrt(28) and sqrt(19)+sqrt(22) without squaring? Maybe by comparing the individual terms?\n\nLet me see. sqrt(8) is approximately 2.828, sqrt(28) is approximately 5.291. So, sqrt(8)+sqrt(28)≈2.828 +5.291≈8.119.\n\nOn the other hand, sqrt(19)≈4.358, sqrt(22)≈4.690. So, sqrt(19)+sqrt(22)≈4.358 +4.690≈9.048.\n\nSo, numerically, 9.048 is larger than 8.119, which confirms our earlier conclusion. Thus, sqrt(19)+sqrt(22) is larger.\n\nSo, the answer is sqrt(19) + sqrt(22). Therefore, I should write that in the box.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute A² and B² with more precision.\n\nCompute sqrt(224):\n\nsqrt(224)=sqrt(16*14)=4*sqrt(14). sqrt(14)=approximately 3.74165738677.\n\nSo, 4*3.74165738677=14.9666295471.\n\nThen, 2*sqrt(224)=29.9332590942.\n\nThus, A²=36 +29.9332590942≈65.9332590942.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(418):\n\nWe can compute sqrt(418) more precisely.\n\nFirst, 20^2=400, 21^2=441.\n\nCompute 20.45^2=?\n\n20 +0.45.\n\n(20 +0.45)^2=20^2 +2*20*0.45 +0.45^2=400 +18 +0.2025=418.2025.\n\nSo, sqrt(418.2025)=20.45.\n\nBut sqrt(418) is slightly less than 20.45.\n\nSo, let me use linear approximation.\n\nLet f(x)=sqrt(x). We know f(418.2025)=20.45.\n\nWe need f(418)=?\n\nLet me compute delta_x="

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(9) + sqrt(35) is larger than sqrt(13) + sqrt(29), or vice versa. Hmm, let's see. I remember that sometimes comparing square roots can be tricky because they don't play along with addition in the same way as regular numbers. Maybe I can square both expressions to make them easier to compare? That might work because squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, so if I square them, the larger one will still be larger.\n\nFirst, let me write down the two expressions:\n\nExpression A: sqrt(9) + sqrt(35)\n\nExpression B: sqrt(13) + sqrt(29)\n\nI need to compare A and B. To do this, I'll square both expressions. Let's compute A squared first.\n\nA squared = (sqrt(9) + sqrt(35))^2\n\nI remember that (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, so applying that here:\n\nA squared = (sqrt(9))^2 + 2*sqrt(9)*sqrt(35) + (sqrt(35))^2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nsqrt(9) is 3, so (sqrt(9))^2 is 9.\n\nsqrt(35)^2 is 35.\n\nThe middle term is 2*sqrt(9)*sqrt(35). sqrt(9) is 3, so that becomes 2*3*sqrt(35) which is 6*sqrt(35).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nA squared = 9 + 6*sqrt(35) + 35\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n9 + 35 = 44\n\nSo, A squared = 44 + 6*sqrt(35)\n\nAlright, now let's compute B squared.\n\nB squared = (sqrt(13) + sqrt(29))^2\n\nAgain, using the same expansion:\n\nB squared = (sqrt(13))^2 + 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(29) + (sqrt(29))^2\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n(sqrt(13))^2 = 13\n\n(sqrt(29))^2 = 29\n\nMiddle term: 2*sqrt(13)*sqrt(29) = 2*sqrt(13*29). Let's compute 13*29: 13*20 is 260, plus 13*9=117, so 260+117=377. So, sqrt(377). So, the middle term is 2*sqrt(377).\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nB squared = 13 + 2*sqrt(377) + 29\n\nCombine constants:\n\n13 + 29 = 42\n\nSo, B squared = 42 + 2*sqrt(377)\n\nNow, we have A squared = 44 + 6*sqrt(35) and B squared = 42 + 2*sqrt(377). We need to compare these two.\n\nHmm, comparing 44 + 6*sqrt(35) and 42 + 2*sqrt(377).\n\nI think it might be useful to approximate the square roots to see which is larger. Let me recall the approximate values:\n\nsqrt(35): 5.916 (since 5.9^2 = 34.81, and 5.92^2 = approx 35.04)\n\nsqrt(377): Let's see, 19^2 is 361, 20^2 is 400. So sqrt(377) is between 19 and 20. Let's compute 19.4^2: 19^2=361, 0.4^2=0.16, and cross term 2*19*0.4=15.2. So, 361 +15.2 +0.16= 376.36. Close to 377. So sqrt(377) is approximately 19.42.\n\nSo, sqrt(35) ≈5.916, sqrt(377)≈19.42.\n\nNow, plug these into A squared and B squared.\n\nCompute A squared:\n\n44 + 6*5.916 ≈44 + 35.496 ≈79.496\n\nCompute B squared:\n\n42 + 2*19.42 ≈42 +38.84≈80.84\n\nSo, A squared≈79.496 and B squared≈80.84. Since 80.84 >79.496, that means B squared is larger than A squared, so B is larger than A.\n\nHence, sqrt(13) + sqrt(29) is larger than sqrt(9) + sqrt(35).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my approximations because sometimes my estimates can be off.\n\nRecalculating sqrt(35):\n\n5.9^2 =34.81\n\n5.91^2 = (5.9 +0.01)^2 =5.9^2 + 2*5.9*0.01 +0.01^2=34.81 +0.118 +0.0001=34.9281\n\n5.92^2= (5.9)^2 + 2*5.9*0.02 +0.02^2=34.81 +0.236 +0.0004=35.0464\n\nSo, 5.91^2=34.9281, 5.92^2=35.0464\n\nSo sqrt(35) is 5.916 approximately. Let me use a calculator-like approach:\n\n35 -34.81=0.19\n\nSo, 0.19 over the interval between 5.91 and 5.92, which is 0.13.\n\nSo, 0.19/0.13≈1.46, so sqrt(35)=5.91 +0.13*1.46≈5.91 +0.19≈6.10? Wait, that can't be because 5.91 +0.19=6.10, which is too big.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use linear approximation.\n\nLet me recall that for f(x)=sqrt(x), f'(x)=1/(2*sqrt(x)).\n\nSo, let me approximate sqrt(35) near x=36.\n\nf(36)=6.\n\nf'(36)=1/(2*6)=1/12≈0.0833\n\nSo, f(35)=f(36) +f'(36)*(35-36)=6 + (-0.0833)*1=6 -0.0833≈5.9167\n\nSo, sqrt(35)=~5.9167.\n\nSo, more accurately, sqrt(35)=~5.9165.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(377):\n\nLet me take x=361 (19^2), f(361)=19.\n\nf'(x)=1/(2*19)=1/38≈0.0263.\n\nWe need sqrt(377). So, 377 is 6 more than 361.\n\nSo, f(377)=f(361) +f'(361)*6=19 +0.0263*6≈19 +0.1578≈19.1578\n\nBut wait, 19.1578^2=?\n\nWait, let me compute (19.1578)^2:\n\n19^2=361\n\n2*19*0.1578=2*19*0.1578≈2*3.00≈6.00\n\n0.1578^2≈0.0249\n\nSo, total≈361 +6 +0.0249≈367.0249\n\nWait, that can't be, because 19.1578^2 is approximately 367.0249, but we're trying to reach 377.\n\nSo, my approximation is off by about 6. So, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, maybe I should do a better linear approximation.\n\nWe have f(x)=sqrt(x), f'(x)=1/(2*sqrt(x))\n\nI need to approximate sqrt(377) near x=361 (which is 19^2). So, 377 is 377-361=16 away from 361.\n\nSo, f(377)=f(361) +f'(361)*16=19 + (1/(2*"

    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(9) + sqrt(43) is larger than sqrt(30) + sqrt(34) or vice versa. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute each square root individually to see what values I'm dealing with. Starting with sqrt(9), that's straightforward because 9 is a perfect square. So sqrt(9) equals 3. \n\nNow, moving on to sqrt(43). I know that 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so sqrt(43) must be between 6 and 7. Let me get a better approximation. 6.5 squared is 42.25, so sqrt(43) is just a little over 6.5, maybe around 6.55 or so. I'll keep that in mind for later.\n\nNext, sqrt(30). Similarly, 5 squared is 25 and 6 squared is 36, so sqrt(30) must be between 5 and 6. Let me see, 5.5 squared is 30.25. Oh, so sqrt(30) is just a tiny bit less than 5.5, maybe around 5.477 or something. Hmm, that's interesting because sqrt(34) is also close to that.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute sqrt(34) as well. 5.8 squared is 33.64, and 5.9 squared is 34.81. So sqrt(34) is between 5.8 and 5.9. Let me approximate closer. 5.86 squared is 5.86 * 5.86. Let me calculate that: 5 * 5 = 25, 5 * 0.86 = 4.3, 0.86 * 5 = 4.3, and 0.86 * 0.86 is about 0.7396. So adding those up: 25 + 4.3 + 4.3 + 0.7396 ≈ 34.3396. Hmm, that's actually slightly less than 34.81. Wait, so 5.86 squared is about 34.3396, which is less than 34.81, which is 5.9 squared. So sqrt(34) is somewhere between 5.86 and 5.9.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to approximate all these square roots exactly because that might complicate things. Instead, perhaps I can compare the sums without calculating each square root separately.\n\nLet me write down the two expressions:\n\n1. sqrt(9) + sqrt(43) = 3 + sqrt(43)\n2. sqrt(30) + sqrt(34)\n\nI need to figure out which is larger: 3 + sqrt(43) or sqrt(30) + sqrt(34).\n\nHmm, maybe I can square both expressions to eliminate the square roots, but I have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. However, since both expressions are sums of positive numbers, squaring them shouldn't cause any issues. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(9) + sqrt(43) and B = sqrt(30) + sqrt(34). So, I need to compare A and B.\n\nFirst, compute A squared:\n\nA² = (sqrt(9) + sqrt(43))² = 9 + 2*sqrt(9*43) + 43 = 52 + 2*sqrt(387)\n\nSimilarly, compute B squared:\n\nB² = (sqrt(30) + sqrt(34))² = 30 + 2*sqrt(30*34) + 34 = 64 + 2*sqrt(1020)\n\nSo now, I have:\n\nA² = 52 + 2*sqrt(387)\nB² = 64 + 2*sqrt(1020)\n\nI need to compare A² and B². If A² > B², then A > B, and vice versa.\n\nLet me compute the numerical values of these square roots to make the comparison more straightforward.\n\nFirst, sqrt(387). Let's see: 19² is 361, 20² is 400, so sqrt(387) is between 19 and 20. Let me try 19.68 squared: 19 + 0.68. 19.68² = (20 - 0.32)² = 400 - 2*20*0.32 + 0.32² = 400 - 12.8 + 0.1024 ≈ 387.3024. That's actually a bit higher than 387, so sqrt(387) is about 19.675.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(1020): 31² is 961, 32² is 1024, so sqrt(1020) is just a bit less than 32. Let me try 31.95 squared: 32 - 0.05. (32 - 0.05)² = 1024 - 2*32*0.05 + 0.05² = 1024 - 3.2 + 0.0025 ≈ 1020.8025. That's still a bit higher than 1020, so sqrt(1020) is approximately 31.94.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nA² ≈ 52 + 2*19.675 ≈ 52 + 39.35 ≈ 91.35\n\nB² ≈ 64 + 2*31.94 ≈ 64 + 63.88 ≈ 127.88\n\nWait a minute, hold on, that can't be right. If A² is about 91.35 and B² is about 127.88, then B² is definitely larger, which would mean that B is larger than A. But that seems counterintuitive because both sqrt(30) and sqrt(34) are smaller than sqrt(43), but their sum might not necessarily be larger.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again because 19.675 squared is approximately 387, so 2 times that is 39.35, and adding 52 gives 91.35 for A². Similarly, sqrt(1020) is approximately 31.94, so 2 times that is 63.88, and adding 64 gives 127.88 for B². So, 127.88 is indeed larger than 91.35, so B is larger than A. But let me think about this again.\n\nWait, sqrt(30) is about 5.477, sqrt(34) is about 5.830, so their sum is about 11.307, while sqrt(9) is 3, so 3 + sqrt(43) is about 3 + 6.557 ≈ 9.557. So, 9.557 is less than 11.307, which is consistent with B² being larger. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe my approximations for sqrt(387) and sqrt(1020) are a bit off. Let me check with more precise calculations.\n\nFor sqrt(387):\n\nWe had 19.68² ≈ 387.3024, which is slightly higher than 387. So, sqrt(387) is slightly less than 19.68. Let me try 19.675²:\n\n19.675² = (19 + 0.675)² = 19² + 2*19*0.675 + 0.675² = 361 + 25.65 + 0.4556 ≈ 387.1056\n\nThat's very close to 387.1056, which is just slightly more than 387. So, sqrt(387) is approximately 19.675 - a tiny bit, maybe 19.674 or 19.675.\n\nSimilarly, for sqrt(1020):\n\nWe had 31.95² ≈ 1020.8025, which is a bit more than 1020, so sqrt(1020) is approximately 31.95 - 0.05. Let me compute 31.94²:\n\n31.94² = (32 - 0.0"

To approximate it, I can think about 3.4 squared is 11.56, which is close to 12. So, sqrt(12) is approximately 3.464. Let me write that down: sqrt(12) ≈ 3.464.\n\nNext, sqrt(17). Similarly, I know sqrt(16) is 4, so sqrt(17) must be a bit more than 4. Let me calculate 4.1 squared: that's 16.81. Hmm, that's close to 17. Let me try 4.12 squared: 4.12 times 4.12. Let me compute 4 squared is 16, 0.12 squared is 0.0144, and then cross terms: 2 times 4 times 0.12 is 0.96. So, adding them up: 16 + 0.96 + 0.0144 = 16.9744. That's pretty close to 17. So, sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have 4.1 squared, which is 16.81, and 4.12 squared is 16.9744, which is still a bit less than 17. So, maybe 4.123 is the approximate value? Let me square 4.123: 4.123 * 4.123. Hmm, 4 * 4 is 16, 4 * 0.123 is 0.492, 0.123 * 4 is another 0.492, and 0.123 * 0.123 is approximately 0.0151. So, adding them all up: 16 + 0.492 + 0.492 + 0.0151 ≈ 16 + 0.984 + 0.0151 ≈ 17.0, approximately. So, sqrt(17) ≈ 4.123.\n\nSo, putting it all together, sqrt(12) is approximately 3.464 and sqrt(17) is approximately 4.123. Adding those together: 3.464 + 4.123. Let me add the whole numbers first: 3 + 4 is 7. Then, the decimals: 0.464 + 0.123 is 0.587. So, in total, sqrt(12) + sqrt(17) is approximately 7.587.\n\nWait a minute, the other expression was sqrt(4) + sqrt(25) which we simplified to 7. So, 7 versus approximately 7.587. Which one is larger? 7.587 is larger than 7, so sqrt(12) + sqrt(17) is the larger one.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my approximations because sometimes approximations can be misleading. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.\n\nLet me use a calculator for sqrt(12) and sqrt(17). Wait, I don't have a calculator handy, but I can compute it more precisely.\n\nStarting with sqrt(12): 3.464 is approximate, but let's see:\n\n3.464 squared is:\n\n3.464 * 3.464:\n\nFirst, 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n3 * 0.464 = 1.392.\n\n0.464 * 3 = 1.392.\n\n0.464 * 0.464 ≈ 0.215.\n\nSo, adding all these up:\n\n9 + 1.392 + 1.392 + 0.215 ≈ 9 + 2.784 + 0.215 ≈ 11.999, which is approximately 12. So, 3.464 squared is approximately 12, so sqrt(12) is indeed about 3.464.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(17):\n\nLet me compute 4.123 squared:\n\n4.123 * 4.123: 4 * 4 = 16.\n\n4 * 0.123 = 0.492.\n\n0.123 * 4 = 0.492.\n\n0.123 * 0.123 ≈ 0.015.\n\nAdding these all together: 16 + 0.492 + 0.492 + 0.015 ≈ 16 + 0.984 + 0.015 ≈ 17.0, which is exact. So, sqrt(17) is exactly 4.123, so our approximation was correct.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(12) + sqrt(17) is approximately 3.464 + 4.123 = 7.587, which is indeed more than 7. So, sqrt(12) + sqrt(17) is larger.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, is there another way to compare sqrt(4) + sqrt(25) and sqrt(12) + sqrt(17) without approximating? Maybe by squaring both expressions? Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(4) + sqrt(25) = 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nLet me denote B = sqrt(12) + sqrt(17).\n\nI need to compare A and B. To do this, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and see which is larger.\n\nCompute A^2: 7^2 = 49.\n\nCompute B^2: (sqrt(12) + sqrt(17))^2 = (sqrt(12))^2 + 2*sqrt(12)*sqrt(17) + (sqrt(17))^2 = 12 + 2*sqrt(204) + 17 = 29 + 2*sqrt(204).\n\nSo, B^2 = 29 + 2*sqrt(204).\n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(204). Hmm, 14^2 is 196, 15^2 is 225. So, sqrt(204) is between 14 and 15.\n\n14.2^2 = 14.2*14.2. Let's compute that: 14*14 = 196, 14*0.2 = 2.8, 0.2*14 = 2.8, 0.2*0.2 = 0.04. So, total is 196 + 2.8 + 2.8 + 0.04 = 196 + 5.6 + 0.04 = 201.64.\n\nHmm, 14.2 squared is 201.64, which is less than 204. Let me try 14.3 squared: 14.3*14.3. 14*14=196, 14*0.3=4.2, 0.3*14=4.2, 0.3*0.3=0.09. So, 196 + 4.2 + 4.2 + 0.09 = 196 + 8.4 + 0.09 = 204.49.\n\nAh, so 14.3 squared is 204.49, which is a bit more than 204. So, sqrt(204) is approximately 14.28.\n\nWait, let me check: 14.28 squared"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I need to compare these two expressions: sqrt(4) + sqrt(48) and sqrt(21) + sqrt(38). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I can simplify each square root to see if that helps. Starting with sqrt(4), that's straightforward—sqrt(4) is 2. So the first expression simplifies to 2 + sqrt(48). Now, sqrt(48) can be simplified further because 48 is 16 times 3, right? So sqrt(48) is sqrt(16*3) which is sqrt(16)*sqrt(3) which is 4*sqrt(3). So now the first expression is 2 + 4*sqrt(3).\n\nAlright, moving on to the second expression: sqrt(21) + sqrt(38). These don't seem to have any perfect square factors, so I can't simplify them further. So that's as simplified as it gets for now. So, now I have the two expressions:\n\nFirst expression: 2 + 4*sqrt(3)\n\nSecond expression: sqrt(21) + sqrt(38)\n\nI need to figure out which one is larger. Maybe I can square both expressions and then compare them. That might make it easier because squaring should preserve the inequality if both are positive, which they are here.\n\nSo let's denote A = 2 + 4*sqrt(3) and B = sqrt(21) + sqrt(38). Then, I can compute A^2 and B^2 and compare them.\n\nCalculating A^2: (2 + 4*sqrt(3))^2. Using the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n\nSo, A^2 = (2)^2 + 2*(2)*(4*sqrt(3)) + (4*sqrt(3))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- (2)^2 = 4\n\n- 2*(2)*(4*sqrt(3)) = 2*2*4*sqrt(3) = 16*sqrt(3)\n\n- (4*sqrt(3))^2 = 16*(sqrt(3))^2 = 16*3 = 48\n\nSo, adding these up: A^2 = 4 + 16*sqrt(3) + 48 = 52 + 16*sqrt(3)\n\nNow, calculating B^2: (sqrt(21) + sqrt(38))^2. Again, using (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n\nSo, B^2 = (sqrt(21))^2 + 2*sqrt(21)*sqrt(38) + (sqrt(38))^2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- (sqrt(21))^2 = 21\n\n- 2*sqrt(21)*sqrt(38) = 2*sqrt(21*38). Let me compute 21*38. 20*38 is 760, plus 1*38 is 38, so 760 + 38 = 798. So, 2*sqrt(798)\n\n- (sqrt(38))^2 = 38\n\nAdding these up: B^2 = 21 + 2*sqrt(798) + 38 = 59 + 2*sqrt(798)\n\nSo now, I need to compare A^2 = 52 + 16*sqrt(3) and B^2 = 59 + 2*sqrt(798).\n\nHmm, comparing these two seems tricky because they involve square roots. Maybe I can approximate the values.\n\nFirst, let's approximate sqrt(3). That's approximately 1.732. So 16*sqrt(3) is 16*1.732 ≈ 27.712. Then, A^2 ≈ 52 + 27.712 ≈ 79.712.\n\nNow, let's approximate sqrt(798). Since 28^2 = 784 and 29^2 = 841, sqrt(798) is somewhere between 28 and 29. Let's calculate 28.2^2: 28^2 = 784, 0.2^2 = 0.04, and cross terms: 2*28*0.2 = 11.2. So, 784 + 11.2 + 0.04 = 795.24. That's still less than 798.\n\nNext, 28.3^2: 28^2 = 784, 0.3^2 = 0.09, cross terms: 2*28*0.3 = 16.8. So, 784 + 16.8 + 0.09 = 800.89. That's more than 798. So sqrt(798) is between 28.2 and 28.3.\n\nLet me approximate it more precisely. Let's compute when 28.2^2 = 795.24, and 28.2 + x)^2 = 798.\n\nSo, expanding (28.2 + x)^2 = 28.2^2 + 2*28.2*x + x^2 = 798.\n\nWe know that 28.2^2 is 795.24, so 795.24 + 56.4x + x^2 = 798.\n\nSubtract 795.24: 56.4x + x^2 = 2.76.\n\nAssuming x is small, x^2 is negligible, so 56.4x ≈ 2.76 => x ≈ 2.76 / 56.4 ≈ 0.049.\n\nSo, sqrt(798) ≈ 28.2 + 0.049 ≈ 28.249. Let me check 28.249^2:\n\n28^2 = 784, 0.249^2 ≈ 0.062, cross terms: 2*28*0.249 ≈ 13.896. So total is 784 + 13.896 + 0.062 ≈ 797.958, which is pretty close to 798. So, sqrt(798) ≈ 28.249.\n\nTherefore, 2*sqrt(798) ≈ 2*28.249 ≈ 56.498.\n\nSo, B^2 ≈ 59 + 56.498 ≈ 115.498.\n\nSo, back to A^2 ≈ 79.712 and B^2 ≈ 115.498. Therefore, B^2 is larger. Since both A and B are positive, this means that B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(21) + sqrt(38) is larger than sqrt(4) + sqrt(48). So, the larger number is sqrt(21) + sqrt(38).\n\nBut wait, let me just double-check my calculations because approximations can sometimes lead to errors.\n\nCalculating A^2: 2 + 4*sqrt(3) squared. 2^2 is 4, 2*2*4*sqrt(3) is 16*sqrt(3), and (4*sqrt(3))^2 is 16*3 is 48. So, 4 + 16*sqrt(3) + 48 is indeed 52 + 16*sqrt(3). 16*1.732 is about 27.712, so 52 +27.712 is 79.712. That seems correct.\n\nCalculating B^2: sqrt(21) + sqrt(38). So, (sqrt(21))^2 is 21, (sqrt(38))^2 is 38, so 21 + 38 is 59. Then, 2*sqrt(21)*sqrt(38) is 2*sqrt(798). As above, sqrt(798) is approximately 28.249, so 2*28.249 is approximately 56.498. So, 59 + 56.498 is approximately 115.498. That also seems correct.\n\nTherefore, since 115.498 is greater than 79.712, B^2 > A^2, so B > A. So, sqrt(21) + sqrt(38) is larger.\n\nBut wait, let me just check if my approximations for sqrt(79"

    "prompt": "Compare sqrt(5) + sqrt(36) and sqrt(16) + sqrt(29). Which is larger? Write down the larger number in the form \\boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)}.\n<think>\n",
    "generated_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether sqrt(5) plus sqrt(36) is larger than sqrt(16) plus sqrt(29), or vice versa. Hmm, let me write down the expressions first to get a clear view.\n\nThe first expression is sqrt(5) + sqrt(36). I know that sqrt(36) is 6 because 6 times 6 is 36. So that simplifies a bit. Let me calculate that: sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, and adding that to 6 gives me roughly 8.236. Okay, so that's one value.\n\nNow, the second expression is sqrt(16) + sqrt(29). I know sqrt(16) is 4 because 4 times 4 is 16. So that simplifies to 4 plus sqrt(29). What is sqrt(29)? Let me approximate that. 5 squared is 25, and 5.4 squared is 29.16 because 5.4 times 5.4 is 29.16. So sqrt(29) is approximately 5.385. Adding that to 4 gives me roughly 9.385.\n\nSo now, comparing the two results: the first one is about 8.236, and the second one is about 9.385. So it looks like 9.385 is larger than 8.236, which means the second expression is larger.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first expression, sqrt(5) is indeed approximately 2.236, and sqrt(36) is exactly 6. Adding them together gives 8.236. That seems right.\n\nFor the second expression, sqrt(16) is 4, and sqrt(29) is approximately 5.385. Adding them together should give 4 + 5.385, which is 9.385. Hmm, wait, I think I might have messed up the addition there. 4 plus 5.385 is 9.385, right? Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 9.385 is greater than 8.236, which means sqrt(16) + sqrt(29) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(36). Therefore, the larger number is sqrt(16) + sqrt(29). \n\nLet me just think if there's another way to compare them without calculating the approximate decimal values. Maybe by squaring both expressions and comparing the results? Let me try that.\n\nLet A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(36) = sqrt(5) + 6, and B = sqrt(16) + sqrt(29) = 4 + sqrt(29).\n\nIf I square A: A² = (sqrt(5) + 6)² = (sqrt(5))² + 2*sqrt(5)*6 + 6² = 5 + 12*sqrt(5) + 36 = 41 + 12*sqrt(5).\n\nSimilarly, squaring B: B² = (4 + sqrt(29))² = 4² + 2*4*sqrt(29) + (sqrt(29))² = 16 + 8*sqrt(29) + 29 = 45 + 8*sqrt(29).\n\nNow, I need to compare 41 + 12*sqrt(5) and 45 + 8*sqrt(29). Let's subtract 41 from both sides to make it simpler: 12*sqrt(5) vs. 4 + 8*sqrt(29).\n\nSo, 12*sqrt(5) vs. 8*sqrt(29) + 4.\n\nHmm, that's a bit more complicated. Maybe I can factor out something. Let's see:\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to simplify: 3*sqrt(5) vs. 2*sqrt(29) + 1.\n\nSo now, I need to compare 3*sqrt(5) and 2*sqrt(29) + 1.\n\nLet me compute both sides numerically:\n\n3*sqrt(5) is 3 times approximately 2.236, which is about 6.708.\n\n2*sqrt(29) is 2 times approximately 5.385, which is about 10.770, and then adding 1 gives 11.770.\n\nSo, 6.708 vs. 11.770. Clearly, 11.770 is larger. Therefore, the original squared B (which is 45 + 8*sqrt(29)) is larger than squared A (which is 41 + 12*sqrt(5)), so B is larger than A. Therefore, sqrt(16) + sqrt(29) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(36).\n\nWait, that seems consistent with my earlier decimal calculation. So both methods confirm that B is larger than A.\n\nAlternatively, another way I can think about it is by considering the differences. Let's see:\n\nB = 4 + sqrt(29)\nA = 6 + sqrt(5)\n\nSo, B - A = (4 - 6) + (sqrt(29) - sqrt(5)) = (-2) + (sqrt(29) - sqrt(5)).\n\nWe can approximate sqrt(29) - sqrt(5):\n\nsqrt(29) is approximately 5.385, and sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236. So, 5.385 - 2.236 is approximately 3.149. Then, subtract 2, we get approximately 1.149, which is positive. Therefore, B - A is positive, meaning B is larger than A.\n\nOkay, so that also confirms the result. So, both decimal approximations, squaring the expressions, and comparing the differences all lead to the same conclusion: sqrt(16) + sqrt(29) is larger than sqrt(5) + sqrt(36).\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(16) + sqrt(29), which can be written in the form boxed{sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)} as required.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{16} + \\sqrt{29}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\( \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{36} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{16} + \\sqrt{29} \\), we start by simplifying each expression.\n\nFirst, we simplify \\( \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{36} \\):\n- \\( \\sqrt{36} = 6 \\)\n- Therefore, \\( \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{36} = \\sqrt{5} + 6 \\approx 2.236 + 6 = 8.236 \\)\n\nNext, we simplify \\( \\sqrt{16} + \\sqrt{29} \\):\n- \\( \\sqrt{16} = 4 \\)\n- Therefore, \\( \\sqrt{16} + \\sqrt{29} = 4 + \\sqrt{29} \\approx 4 + 5.385 = 9.385 \\)\n\nComparing the two results:\n- \\( 8.236 \\) (from \\( \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{36} \\)) is less than \\( 9.385 \\) (from \\( \\sqrt{16} + \\sqrt{29} \\)).\n\nTo confirm, we can square both expressions:\n- Let \\( A = \\sqrt{5} + 6 \\), then \\( A^2 = (\\sqrt{5} + 6)^2 = 5 + 12\\sqrt{5} + 36 = 41 + 12\\sqrt{5} \\)\n- Let \\( B = 4 + \\sqrt{29} \\), then \\( B^2 = (4 + \\sqrt{29})^2 = 16 + 8\\sqrt{29} + 29 = 45 + 8\\sqrt{29} \\)\n\nComparing \\( 41 + 12\\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( 45 + 8\\sqrt{29} \\):\n- Subtract 41 from both sides: \\( 12\\sqrt{5} \\) vs. \\( 4 + 8\\sqrt{29} \\)\n- Divide by 4: \\( 3\\sqrt{5} \\) vs. \\( 2\\sqrt{29} + 1 \\)\n- Approximate values: \\( 3\\sqrt{5} \\approx 6.708 \\) and \\( 2\\sqrt{29} + 1 \\approx 11.770 \\)\n\nSince \\( 11.770 \\) is larger than \\( 6.708 \\), \\( B^2 \\) is larger than \\( A^2 \\), confirming \\( B \\) is larger than \\( A \\).\n\nThus, the larger number is \\( \\sqrt{16} +"

Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that comparing square roots can sometimes be tricky because they don't follow the same rules as regular numbers. So, I need to figure out a way to make these sums comparable. Maybe I can compute each value numerically, but that might not give me the exact comparison. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to compare them without calculating their approximate decimal values.\n\nLet me first write down the two expressions:\n\nExpression 1: sqrt(2) + sqrt(48)\n\nExpression 2: sqrt(8) + sqrt(41)\n\nI need to determine which one is larger.\n\nOne approach is to compare each term separately. Maybe I can compare sqrt(2) and sqrt(8), and sqrt(48) and sqrt(41). But I don't know if that's a valid approach because addition isn't linear like that. For example, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) isn't necessarily equal to sqrt(a + b). So, I can't directly compare the individual terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can square both expressions to make them comparable. Since squaring is a monotonic function for non-negative numbers, if I can show that one squared is larger than the other, then the original expressions will have the same relationship.\n\nLet me try that. Let's consider the squares of both expressions.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = sqrt(2) + sqrt(48)\n\nB = sqrt(8) + sqrt(41)\n\nCompute A^2 and B^2.\n\nA^2 = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(48))^2\n\n= (sqrt(2))^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(48) + (sqrt(48))^2\n\n= 2 + 2*sqrt(96) + 48\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(41))^2\n\n= (sqrt(8))^2 + 2*sqrt(8)*sqrt(41) + (sqrt(41))^2\n\n= 8 + 2*sqrt(328) + 41\n\nSo, now compute A^2 and B^2:\n\nA^2 = 2 + 48 + 2*sqrt(96) = 50 + 2*sqrt(96)\n\nB^2 = 8 + 41 + 2*sqrt(328) = 49 + 2*sqrt(328)\n\nNow, compare A^2 and B^2.\n\nSo, we have A^2 = 50 + 2*sqrt(96) and B^2 = 49 + 2*sqrt(328).\n\nSo, which is larger? 50 + 2*sqrt(96) vs 49 + 2*sqrt(328).\n\nSubtract 49 from both sides:\n\n1 + 2*sqrt(96) vs 2*sqrt(328)\n\nSo, is 1 + 2*sqrt(96) less than or greater than 2*sqrt(328)?\n\nCompute the numerical values.\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(96). Since 96 is 16*6, sqrt(96) = 4*sqrt(6) ≈ 4*2.449 ≈ 9.796\n\nThen, 2*sqrt(96) ≈ 2*9.796 ≈ 19.592\n\nSo, 1 + 19.592 ≈ 20.592\n\nNow, compute sqrt(328). Let's see, 18^2 is 324, so sqrt(328) is a bit more than 18, approximately 18.11.\n\nSo, 2*sqrt(328) ≈ 2*18.11 ≈ 36.22\n\nComparing 20.592 and 36.22, clearly 36.22 is larger. Therefore, 1 + 2*sqrt(96) ≈ 20.592 < 36.22 ≈ 2*sqrt(328). So, that implies that B^2 > A^2.\n\nTherefore, since B^2 > A^2 and both A and B are positive, it follows that B > A.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(8) + sqrt(41) is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(48).\n\nBut wait, the question says to write down the larger number in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b). So, sqrt(8) + sqrt(41) is already in that form, but let me check if this can be simplified further or if it's in the simplest form.\n\nWell, sqrt(8) can be simplified as 2*sqrt(2), but in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b), we have sqrt(8) + sqrt(41). So, unless the question requires the terms to be as simplified as possible, which isn't specified, sqrt(8) + sqrt(41) is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) with a = 8 and b = 41. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you square, you might introduce extraneous results or lose information. Let me recheck.\n\nCompute A^2 = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(48))^2.\n\nWhich is (sqrt(2))^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(48) + (sqrt(48))^2.\n\nWhich is 2 + 2*sqrt(96) + 48.\n\nWhich is 50 + 2*sqrt(96).\n\nSimilarly, B^2 = (sqrt(8) + sqrt(41))^2.\n\nWhich is 8 + 2*sqrt(328) + 41.\n\nWhich is 49 + 2*sqrt(328).\n\nThen, 50 + 2*sqrt(96) vs 49 + 2*sqrt(328).\n\nSo, 50 vs 49: 50 is 1 more than 49.\n\nThen, 2*sqrt(96) vs 2*sqrt(328): sqrt(96) is approximately 9.798, so 2*sqrt(96) ≈ 19.596.\n\nsqrt(328) is approximately 18.11, so 2*sqrt(328) ≈ 36.22.\n\nTherefore, A^2 ≈ 50 + 19.596 ≈ 69.596.\n\nB^2 ≈ 49 + 36.22 ≈ 85.22.\n\nTherefore, 69.596 < 85.22, so A^2 < B^2, so A < B.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(8) + sqrt(41) is larger.\n\nSo, the answer is sqrt(8) + sqrt(41). But let me think again: is there any other way to compare them without squaring?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute both expressions numerically to see which is larger.\n\nCompute sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142\n\nsqrt(48): sqrt(16*3)=4*sqrt(3)≈4*1.732≈6.9282\n\nSo, sqrt(2) + sqrt(48)≈1.4142 + 6.9282≈8.3424.\n\nNow, sqrt(8): sqrt(8)=2*sqrt(2)≈2*1.4142≈2.8284\n\nsqrt(41): sqrt(36 +5)=6 + sqrt(5)/something? Wait, 6^2=36, 7^2=49, so sqrt(41)≈6.4031\n\nSo, sqrt(8) + sqrt(41)≈2.8284 + 6.4031≈9.2315\n\nTherefore, numerically, sqrt(8) + sqrt(41)≈9.2315 is larger than sqrt(2) + sqrt(48)≈8.3424.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the larger number is sqrt(8) + sqrt(41), which is already in the form sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) with a=8 and b=41.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe larger number is \\boxed{\\sqrt{8} + \\sqrt{41}}.\n</think>\n\nTo compare \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{48}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{8} + \\sqrt{41}\\), we can square both expressions to make them comparable.\n\nFirst, consider the square of each expression:\n\nFor \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{48}\\):\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{"

    "generated_text": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to compare sqrt(5) + sqrt(35) and sqrt(22) + sqrt(27). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that sometimes you can compare these kinds of expressions by squaring them, but I'm not entirely sure if that will work here. Let me try it out.\n\nFirst, let's denote A = sqrt(5) + sqrt(35) and B = sqrt(22) + sqrt(27). I need to figure out whether A is larger than B or vice versa. Maybe if I square both A and B, I can compare them without having to deal with the square roots directly. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with A squared: (sqrt(5) + sqrt(35))^2. Using the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, I can expand this. So, that would be (sqrt(5))^2 + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(35) + (sqrt(35))^2. Calculating each term:\n\n- (sqrt(5))^2 is just 5.\n- (sqrt(35))^2 is 35.\n- The middle term is 2*sqrt(5*35). Let me compute 5*35 first. 5 times 35 is 175, so it's 2*sqrt(175). Hmm, sqrt(175) can be simplified, right? 175 is 25*7, so sqrt(25*7) is 5*sqrt(7). Therefore, 2*sqrt(175) becomes 2*5*sqrt(7) = 10*sqrt(7).\n\nSo putting it all together, A squared is 5 + 10*sqrt(7) + 35. That simplifies to 40 + 10*sqrt(7). Okay, so A squared is 40 + 10*sqrt(7).\n\nNow, let's do the same for B squared: (sqrt(22) + sqrt(27))^2. Again, expanding using (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n\n- (sqrt(22))^2 is 22.\n- (sqrt(27))^2 is 27.\n- The middle term is 2*sqrt(22*27). Let me compute 22*27. 22*20 is 440, and 22*7 is 154, so 440 + 154 is 594. So, it's 2*sqrt(594).\n\nSimplifying sqrt(594). Let me factor 594. 594 divided by 2 is 297. 297 divided by 3 is 99, which is 9*11. So, 594 is 2*3^3*11. So, sqrt(594) can be written as sqrt(9*66) because 594 is 9*66, and 9 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(9*66) is 3*sqrt(66). Therefore, 2*sqrt(594) is 2*3*sqrt(66) = 6*sqrt(66).\n\nSo, B squared is 22 + 6*sqrt(66) + 27. That simplifies to 49 + 6*sqrt(66).\n\nNow, I have A squared = 40 + 10*sqrt(7) and B squared = 49 + 6*sqrt(66). I need to figure out which is larger. Let me compute both values numerically to get a sense.\n\nFirst, sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458. So, 10*sqrt(7) is roughly 26.458. Adding that to 40 gives 40 + 26.458 = 66.458.\n\nNext, sqrt(66). Let me calculate that. Well, 8^2 is 64 and 9^2 is 81, so sqrt(66) is somewhere between 8 and 9. Let's compute 8.1^2=65.61, 8.2^2=67.24. So, sqrt(66) is approximately 8.124. Therefore, 6*sqrt(66) is about 6*8.124=48.744. Adding that to 49 gives 49 + 48.744=97.744.\n\nSo, A squared is approximately 66.458 and B squared is approximately 97.744. Therefore, B squared is larger than A squared, which suggests that B is larger than A.\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, I should make sure that squaring the numbers isn't introducing any errors or complexities. Sometimes, squaring can sometimes reverse the order, but in this case, since both A and B are positive numbers, their squares should preserve the order. So, if B squared is larger, then B is larger than A.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me think about another approach. Maybe I can compare the terms without squaring. Let's see.\n\nI know that sqrt(35) is sqrt(5*7) and sqrt(22) is sqrt(2*11) and sqrt(27) is sqrt(3^3). Maybe I can compare the individual terms.\n\nWait, another idea: express both expressions in terms of sqrt(5). Let's see.\n\nsqrt(35) is sqrt(5*7) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(7). Similarly, sqrt(22) is sqrt(2*11), and sqrt(27) is sqrt(3^3) = 3*sqrt(3). So, let me rewrite A and B:\n\nA = sqrt(5) + sqrt(5)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(5)*(1 + sqrt(7)).\n\nB = sqrt(22) + sqrt(27) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(11) + 3*sqrt(3). Hmm, not sure if that helps much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approximate sqrt(7) and sqrt(66) to more decimal places to get a better idea.\n\nEarlier, I approximated sqrt(7) as 2.6458, which is precise to four decimal places. Let me check my computation for sqrt(66). 8.124^2 is 65.997, which is very close to 66, so sqrt(66) is approximately 8.124.\n\nSo, 10*sqrt(7) is 26.458, and adding to 40 gives 66.458. For B squared, 6*sqrt(66) is 6*8.124=48.744, and adding to 49 gives 97.744.\n\nSo, A squared is about 66.458, and B squared is about 97.744, so B squared is definitely larger. Therefore, B is larger than A.\n\nBut just to ensure I didn't make a mistake in computing sqrt(66), let me verify it another way. Let me use a calculator approach, although I don't have a physical one, but I can estimate.\n\nWe know that 8.124^2 is 66. So, 8.124 squared is:\n\n8*8 = 64\n\n8*0.124*2 = 8*0.248 = 1.984\n\n0.124^2 = 0.015376\n\nSo, adding them together: 64 + 1.984 + 0.015376 = 66. So, yes, 8.124 squared is exactly 66. So, sqrt(66) is exactly 8.124 approximately.\n\nSo, 6*8.124 is 48.744, and 49 is 49. So, adding 49 + 48.744 is 97.744. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(7) is approximately 2.6458. So, 10*sqrt(7) is 26.458, and 40 + 26.458 is 66.458. So, that's correct as well.\n\nThus, A squared is approximately 66.458, and B squared is approximately 97.744, so B squared is larger, meaning B is larger than A.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that my squaring step didn't involve any miscalculations.\n\nLet me compute A squared again:\n\n(sqrt(5) + sqrt(35))^2 = (sqrt(5))^2 + 2*sqrt(5)*sqrt(35) + (sqrt(35))^2 = 5 + "
